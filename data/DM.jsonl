Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience.

Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.'

{"input": "Lucas (left) and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during Sunday's All-Star charity game at Anfield . Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is looking to recapture what he considers his best form in two years after recovering from injury. The Brazil international enjoyed a run of 16 starts in 19 matches from late November - which coincided with a marked improvement in the team's results - until a groin problem in February's Merseyside derby saw him miss 10 games. He was an unused substitute in the defeat by Manchester United immediately before the international break, their first in the league since mid-December, but played 90 minutes in Sunday's All-Star Charity game at Anfield. Lucas's return to fitness could not have come at a more opportune moment, with captain Steven Gerrard suspended for three matches for his sending off against United, and the Brazilian is hoping to slot back in seamlessly after injury halted what was turning into a good season personally. 'I was in a very good moment, probably the best moment in the last couple of years, and I had a good run of games,' he said. 'The beginning of the season wasn't good for me because I couldn't play much, but as soon as I got back in the team I think I helped a lot. 'I don't know if Stevie's suspension will change things because the team were playing well, but I need to be ready and there are a lot of games to play and the FA Cup as well, so everyone will be needed. 'I need to be ready and if I get a chance again I need to be at the same level I was before I was injured.' Lucas attempts to spoil Luis's Suarez's return to Anfield with a tackle in the charity match . Fifth-placed Liverpool head to Arsenal on Saturday knowing they cannot realistically afford to lose if they are to keep pace with the top four, but in addition to Gerrard's absence they will also be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present this season, after he was retrospectively banned for standing on United goalkeeper David de Gea. 'Martin is having a fantastic season again. He has been a very consistent player for us and losing him and Stevie is hard to take, but if you want to be successful you can't rely on one or two players,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'Both are very important players for us as one can change a game and the other gives us stability at the back, but we have other players as well who can step in. 'It's always been the case for the group that if someone gets injured then someone will step in and do the job. 'That's how it should be and we shouldn't be afraid we don't have them. 'Of course it's going to be a big miss not having Stevie and Skrts, but we have to show we can cope for the three games and then we have them back ready to go again.' Lucas's spoiling in midfield helped Liverpool go on an impressive run before Christmas . The Brazilian is aiming to take advantage of Gerrard's absence in he next three games . Lucas rejected the chance to have some time off during the international break in order to make sure he was fully fit for the resumption of the Premier League. 'I feel great. Leading up to the Manchester United game I had a full week of training as well, so it's been two weeks of full training,' he said. 'I was available for the Manchester United game, but probably wasn't able to play the whole game. Now I feel 100 per cent. 'Of course it's good to have a few days off, but I was away in Brazil while I was having my treatment so it was the right decision to stay here and keep working during the international break. 'If you get too many days off you don't get the sharpness and the rhythm of the training session and that's what I was missing. 'I spoke with the staff and they prepared everything for me as well to make me feel as though I'm in good condition, so it's looking good and hopefully it will only get better. 'Now it's just a question of getting some minutes and training sessions, so that's what I need and what I'm having.

The ex-Rangers youth has been mourning the loss of Shaun Cole, 22, who was found dead in a Miami street last weekend and is thought to have been the victim of a hit-and-run driver. A soldier who had served in Afghanistan, he was on holiday in Florida while on leave and had attended a music festival there before being found on a pavement with a head injury which proved fatal. Livingston boss Mark Burchill is hopeful that midfielder Darren Cole will turn out for his side on Sunday . Livingston star Cole, 23, was close to Shaun and paid tribute to the army private on his Twitter account this week. He wrote: 'I know you won't be here for the rest of our lives but I can promise I'll love you for the rest of mine.' Cole was granted time off by the Championship side as they prepare to face Alloa at McDiarmid Park in their first national final in 11 years. But he returned to training on Wednesday and is due to work with the players again after a squad day off on Thursday.

He will give Cole as much time as he needs to grieve and accept whatever decision he makes - but admits that the former Murray Park youngster has given the impression he would like to be involved. Burchill said: 'Darren was away from the club initially and we don't really know what to expect but I am speaking with him constantly to plan with him. 'He came back to training on Wednesday but is still in a bit of shock after what has happened, which is completely understandable. 'If I'm honest, I really don't know if he is going to play so we will need to see how things go once we get towards Saturday and Sunday. 'I think Darren would like to play but he has never been through something like this before in his life. 'Him and Shaun were much closer than a lot of cousins are. They grew up together, were around the same age and lived in the same area. They were best mates. 'Darren and his family want to find out exactly what happened and get a wee bit of closure because they still don't know the circumstances.

The Frenchman played a major role in helping Juventus clinch their third successive scudetto last season, scoring seven goals and setting up seven more in 36 Serie A appearances for the Bianconeri. Juve, who are still competing on three fronts this season, are currently without Pogba's services after he sustained a hamstring injury last month and was ruled out of action until May.

{"input": "Robbie Neilson insists the likes of captain Danny Wilson will only leave Hearts if he is satisfied it's right for the club. As Sportsmail revealed this week, Celtic have placed former Rangers defender Wilson on a list of potential summer recruits. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Championship clash with the Ibrox club, Neilson admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable. Hearts manager Robbie Neilson will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club . Echoing the view of owner Ann Budge, however, the Tynecastle coach says departures will only happen on his say-so if the price is right. 'If you do really well in the Championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest,' admitted Neilson. 'That is football. 'There has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract, who we are negotiating with at the moment. 'I would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them. 'What I would say is: I wouldn't expect to lose anyone that I don't want to lose. If there are people I want to keep, I expect to keep them. Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish Premiership under Neilson's stewardship . 'If teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us, then I'll expect to lose them. 'What I don't expect to happen is someone moves on and we are not happy about it. If someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player.' Parkhead coach Ronny Deila admitted Wilson, a one-time \u00a32million signing for Liverpool, is on his list of potential replacements for Jason Denayer and Virgil van Dijk, linked with Sunderland and Southampton. With a shrug of resignation, Neilson added: 'People talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you. I think it gives you a boost, because you realise that teams admire you and are interested in you. 'When no team is interested in you... that is what unsettles you. You start worrying when nobody is talking about you. If there is interest in players then it just shows that they are doing really well. 'Big clubs talk, but I would like to think the majority of players have enjoyed their season here and would like to have a good crack at the top league. This is a great place to play and, if they do leave, then they must be really careful about where they go.' Owner Ann Budge has set Neilson and his players the target of a top-six finish in the top flight next season . Neilson, alongside director of football Craig Levein, is more focused on bringing new players into Hearts than losing the ones he has. Defender Adam Eckersley is out of contract, with talks to keep him ongoing. 'It is a case of getting things ironed out, really,' continued Neilson. 'There are also players I want to bring in who I am in talks with. The squad needs to change. 'I can't keep the same squad and expect to have the same impact at a higher level. Players will come in, players will go out and things will continue to evolve. Hopefully at the end of it we have a better team than we do now.' With six games of the Championship season to go and promotion already secured, Neilson already knows his targets for his second season as a manager. Speaking at the announcement of a ground-breaking sponsorship deal with charity Save the Children, Budge set her sights on a top-six finish in the Premiership. Captain Danny Wilson has been linked with Celtic, but won't be sold unless it is the right move for Hearts . Accepting the challenge, Neilson said: 'That is a target and life is all about setting yourself targets. I think getting into the top six is a reasonable aim. 'We have good players here already and we will be recruiting again over the summer to get better players in again. 'We have bags of confidence and a massive fanbase, which has backed us to the hilt. We have to aim for the top six. 'That is just the nature of the beast as head coach of a big football club - you need to meet the standards. To be honest, a top-six finish for a club like Hearts - if they had not been in the Championship - would be the bare minimum which should be acceptable.' To that end, there has been no let-up since securing promotion. Hearts players were shocked to be saddled with a triple training session this week despite securing their promotion goal with something to spare. The former Rangers defender (right, pictured against his former club) could join Celtic in the summer . Unbeaten away from home this season, Neilson wants that record to continue at Ibrox, where his side laid down a marker on the first day of the season. 'We had a triple session and, although we weren't out for too long, we were working hard for Sunday,' he revealed. 'We can't just think that we can down tools because we have won the league. 'We have six games and you simply have to win games at Hearts. 'We are not going to take our foot off the gas. It would be easy to just play games in training and say: \"Let's have a jolly up for the week\". 'When you do that, you lose focus and lose sight of what a big game Sunday is. It is a chance to go to Ibrox as champions and hopefully get a result.' Ironically, a third victory of the season over a Rangers side showing signs of improvement under Stuart McCall would benefit arch city rivals Hibernian the most. Of the view Hearts must win games for themselves rather than others, however, Neilson insisted: 'We don't owe that to any other teams - we owe it to ourselves and the fans, for our own personal pride. We have sold out our allocation on Sunday and everyone is paying good money to come and watch us. We need to give everything. It is not fair if we don't perform.'", "answer": "Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish top flight .\nRobbie Neilson believes it is inevitable clubs will come in for his players .\nHe insists he will only sell them if it is the right move for the club .\nHearts play Rangers on Sunday and could help their rivals Hibernian .", "completion": ["Hearts manager Robbie Neilson insists that captain Danny Wilson will only leave the club if it's the right move for the team, despite interest from Celtic."]}
{"input": "Arsenal legend Ian Wright would be disappointed to see Theo Walcott leave north London, and believes his troubled times at the club are down to Arsene Wenger's refusal to play him as a striker. Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines. And with Arsenal pursuing Raheem Sterling and Walcott's contract set to run out next summer, Wright is worried that the Gunners could stand to lose a valuable player. Theo Walcott could be on the way out of Arsenal, and Gunners legend Ian Wright says that would be 'a shame' Wright enjoys Walcott as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club . Walcott started up front for England against Italy on Tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year . 'It's a shame for him, and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad,' he said. 'I really like him at Arsenal but he's got massive decisions to make in the next few months.' Wright also believes the England wideman, who was played in a central role for his country in Italy on Tuesday night, should have been moved into a similar position for his Arsenal. Walcott's pace had seen him likened to the Gunners' record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who made a similar positional switch during his time in north London, but manager Wenger has only briefly experimented with Walcott as a striker. Thierry Henry was prolific as a striker for Arsenal after being moved inside from his familiar wide role . Arsene Wenger has only briefly used Walcott up front, and Wright says it should have been persisted with . Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is an Arsenal target who also has his contract expiring in the near future . 'I always believed Theo should have been a striker at Arsenal with his pace. I thought playing him on the right would last so long and then he would get moved inside,' Wright told Goal. I'm not saying he's the same kind of player as Thierry Henry by any stretch, but I thought Arsene would move him inside. 'I think that's been to his detriment, because he would have learned a lot more about the game and runs he'd have to make.

{"input": "A period of striving came to an end for Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers at the Emirates on Saturday. Hope expired. The manager's 15-minute press conference, where he conceded that his team's chances of qualifying for the Champions League were over, was a requiem for lost opportunities. Rodgers did his best to stay upbeat. The Liverpool manager does not do disconsolate. But he did not pretend that this has not been a difficult season. After their heroic tilt at the title last year, Liverpool have slipped out of contention. It is a bitter pill to swallow for a club that had scented a return to glory. It still feels as if Liverpool are moving forward under Rodgers. It still feels as if he has the confidence, the ability and the strategy to take them back to the top. But there is no disguising the fact that this is an uncomfortable, uncertain time for the manager and his players. Brendan Rodgers admitted Liverpool are unlikely to reach the top four after losing to Arsenal 4-1 on Saturday . Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead as the Gunners went on to win 4-1 at the Emirates . Just four minutes later, Mesut Ozil had doubled the lead for the home side with this brilliant free kick . Alexis Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time to give Arsenal an unassailable lead . When they went on a run in which they lost only once in 17 league games from mid-November through to mid-March, it seemed like last season's magic was coming back. But when that 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United was followed by a crushing 4-1 loss to Arsenal, the perspective changed. Suddenly, the troubles are crowding in on Rodgers. He spent much of his press conference answering questions about Raheem Sterling's refusal to sign the new contract he has been offered. It also became clear there was a new controversy involving Mario Balotelli. When asked why Balotelli was not in the squad, Rodgers found it hard to disguise his frustration. 'He took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed it not able to travel with the team,' Rodgers said. 'He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it but it was just something that he, himself, did not feel comfortable enough to travel with.' The problems with Balotelli, his failure to settle into Rodgers's system, are symbols of the difficulties the club has faced in a season dominated by trying to adapt to life after Luis Suarez and by the long, melancholy farewell to Steven Gerrard, and it has not been easy. Liverpool missed the suspended Gerrard. They missed Martin Skrtel even more. At times, their defending was shambolic. Rodgers spent most of his press conference fielding questions about contract rebel Raheem Sterling . Mario Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal after picking up a slight knock . Rodgers revealed that Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to London . Daniel Sturridge is still feeling his way back from injury and he has not yet rediscovered his confidence. His injury problems added to the sense of loss brought by the transfer of Suarez to Barcelona. Then there is the fact that several of their close-season buys, notably Dejan Lovren, Balotelli and Adam Lallana, have not come close to fulfilling expectations. Emre Can has been a success, Jordan Henderson has had a fine season and Philippe Coutinho has emerged as an outstanding midfielder but nevertheless, failure to make the top four will bring about new problems. Rodgers admitted that the lack of Champions League football would make it harder for the club to hang on to their best players. Wednesday's FA Cup quarter-final replay against Blackburn had now become 'very, very important,' Rodgers admitted. 'The summer was very difficult with losing Luis,' Rodgers said. 'Daniel [Sturridge] was injured from the beginning of the season and the whole integration of new players was an issue. It was like starting again. It was like my first six months. Daniel Sturridge, a second-half substitute at the Emirates, has spent most of the season out injured . It was difficult viewing for Liverpool manager Rodgers as his side imploded in the first half against Arsenal . Long-serving captain Steven Gerrard will leave the cub at the end of the season and join LA Galaxy . 'Up to the defeat against Manchester United we were the form team and playing very, very well. We have been dealt two big blows in these last two games. I very much doubt we will be in the top four now. There is too much ground to make up. That is the realistic view from me. 'Now we must really focus on the FA Cup and that is going to be very, very important for us. There has been a lot of learning that has taken place this year. Young players have improved as the season has gone on and hopefully now we can finish strongly. We need to go into next year and make a really bright start in the opening eight games.' Change is coming. Gerrard, a club icon for nearly 20 years, will be playing in Los Angeles by the time the new season begins. His departure will draw a line under an era at Anfield. Saturday's defeat means that Liverpool's new age will dawn with a team that, once again, has much to prove.", "answer": "Liverpool were beaten 4-1 by Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday .\nClub's top four hopes have been dealt a massive blow with the defeat .\nLiverpool lost to another of their top-four rivals Manchester United before the international break .\nBrendan Rodgers admits that their chances of\u00a0qualifying for next season's Champions League have severely diminished .", "completion": ["Liverpool's manager, Brendan Rodgers, concedes that his team's chances of qualifying for the Champions League are over, following a 4-1 loss to Arsenal, marking a difficult season for the club."]}

{"input": "Confidence in the QPR camp is high heading into Tuesday's crucial Barclays Premier League match at Aston Villa. QPR had lost 13 of 14 league away games before Saturday's vital 4-1 victory at West Brom. The win also saw the west London club to end a five-game losing run, while they remain in 19th place just three points adrift of safety.

{"input": "Does any player fluctuate between world-beater and under-achiever more than Andros Townsend? Currently on a high after his stunning equaliser for England against Italy in Turin on Tuesday night, the 23-year-old Tottenham winger has already had more ups and downs than most players experience in their careers. On his day, Townsend stands in comparison with the very best. He terrifies defenders with his speed and directness \u2013 a trait he also possesses off the pitch judging by his 'told you so' tweet to a critical Paul Merson this week. That ability was first noticed two years ago when he single-handedly tried to save QPR from relegation with a string of virtuoso performances. Later in 2013, he turned in two of the great international displays of recent years when he destroyed Montenegro and Poland at Wembley to book England's place at the World Cup. Andros Townsend unleashes an unstoppable right-footed strike from 20 yards to score England's equaliser . The Tottenham and England winger celebrates his goal against Italy, which was his third for his country . His strike in Turin, measured at 77.2mph, was further evidence he belongs on the top table. 'We are indebted to Andros \u2013 he is a game-changer,' said England manager Roy Hodgson. And yet... How can a player with Townsend's obvious ability be sent out to nine different clubs on loan by Spurs. Why has he still not played a full 90 minutes for his club in the Premier League this season? How come in the autumn it was Townsend rather than Aaron Lennon who was seen as surplus to requirements at White Hart Lane? He has scored as many goals for England as he has done in the Premier League for Spurs. Wingers are by nature of their position more inconsistent than other players. If they are starved of service, they can appear ineffectual. And if they try too hard when they do get the ball, they can squander possession. And even by wingers' standards, Townsend is a risk-taker. It can make him look unstoppable at times and a waste of time at others. Hodgson admitted agonising about giving him a debut ahead of James Milner and Jack Wilshere against Montenegro 18 months ago, but he was man of the match and scored the important third goal in a 4-1 England victory. Townsend celebrates scoring England's third goal against Montenegro in a World Cup qualifier . Townsend as a pundit for ITV during the World Cup . Articulate and bright \u2013 his father Troy is a leading figure in football's anti-racism body Kick It Out \u2013 he was comfortable in the television studio as a pundit at last summer's World Cup when an ankle injury ruled him out of Hodgson's squad. Sometimes intelligence also means a determination to play the game your way, not always appreciated by managers obsessed by tactics. Townsend thrived with Harry Redknapp at QPR but it didn't look as if he fitted in under Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs. He started the season being used for Capital One Cup and Europa League games rather than the important Premier League stuff. Even now, if things aren't going well, the chances are Townsend will be sacrificed. At Old Trafford he was taken off after half an hour when Spurs were being beaten 2-0 by Manchester United. But he is starting games now ahead of \u00a325million Erik Lamela with another rival, Lennon, loaned out to Everton. For his club, he has hit some rarefied heights, most notably a European game against Dynamo Tbilisi when he scored a goal and made two others. When Hodgson's squad was announced for the recent double-header against Lithuania and Italy, Merson claimed Townsend shouldn't have been included. The player had scored for The Three Lions against San Marino this season but missed the Slovenia and Scotland games with another ankle injury, another reason for his inconsistency. Following his equaliser, Townsend tweeted in response: 'Not bad for a player who should be 'nowhere near the squad''. He later added he hoped he had silenced his critics. Townsend looks dejected after his first-half substitution during Tottenham's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United . The truth is Townsend's style may be best suited to international football which after all is cup knockout when you get to the big tournaments. For the grind of a full Premier League season, you can't afford to have one thrilling moment followed by wasting possession or a wayward shot. The statistics back that up. He has scored three goals in seven games for England compared with three in 21 Premier League starts for Spurs. He will have to try to improve on that ratio when he dons his club shirt again at Burnley on Sunday. In that sense, you can understand why Hodgson will continue to pick him regardless of club form. He is, in the manger's words, a game-changer. Tottenham will be hoping that Townsend can replicate his international form for his club .", "answer": "Andros Townsend scored England's equaliser against Italy on Tuesday .\nGoal was the Tottenham winger's third in seven games for England .\nBut Townsend's club form has been patchy in last two seasons .\nChallenge now is for Townsend to replicate international form for Spurs .\nCLICK HERE for the latest Tottenham news .", "completion": ["Andros Townsend, the 23-year-old Tottenham winger, is praised for his stunning equaliser for England against Italy, yet questions remain about his inconsistency and why he has been sent out to nine different clubs on loan by Spurs."]}

Liverpool star Raheem Sterling has already had his name linked with the defending Premier League champions after his contract stalemate at Anfield. Part of the pressure on City to land fresh young talent comes from FA chairman Greg Dyke's proposal to increase the quota of homegrown players to 12 in Premier League squads. Manuel Pellegrini doesn't believe his current crop of Academy players are up to joining Yaya Toure and Co . Manchester City keeper Joe Hart makes a save during training on Wednesday . Wilfried Bony is more likely to be joined by a young star such as Raheem Sterling than an Academy player . And, with the Blues having failed to produce any regular homegrown first team squad members since Micah Richards and Dedryck Boyata, Pellegrini admits the short-term answer to the need for the new talent does not lie within the squad. Pellegrini said: 'I think about the Academy, we must be patient. This club build all these things because young players are important. 'Maybe it's not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. 'I'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the Academy, they will be part of the squad. 'But it's important to be patient, important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it before.'

Sterling (here with Brendan Rodgers) would fit the bill for City if his impasse with Liverpool isn't resolved .

Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. But he said: 'I think it's important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that's the most important thing. 'If they're all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues - especially the Premier League - need the best players to play.'

Alliss, 84, has said that legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has instead prompted a decline in women\u2019s membership. Some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee. But the Equality Act 2010, drafted by the previous Labour government, ruled that this was illegal discrimination, which means that women must now have equal access to the course \u2013 and pay the same membership rates as men. Mr Alliss, a former professional who is one of the game\u2019s most decorated players, claimed that tens of thousands of members of the Ladies\u2019 Golf Union have deserted the organisation since the rules came into force. \u2018I\u2019m told the Ladies\u2019 Golf Union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in,\u2019 Mr Alliss told the Radio Times. \u2018Hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they\u2019ve gone from paying half fare to full fare. It\u2019s caused mayhem.\u2019 He added: \u2018Equality for women: A few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people.\u2019 But Sam Burton, finance director at the Ladies\u2019 Golf Union, said there has only been a decline of 30,000 women since the law came into force, taking membership down to 159,000 by last year. Mrs Burton said: \u2018It\u2019s not good that ladies golf is declining and we have to look at it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the equalities legislation that is to blame. Golf has been dominated by men and we are always going to be the minority in any club that is mixed. But on the whole golf is becoming much more equal.\u2019 Rant: He added: \u2018Equality for women: A few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people.\u2019 She suggested that possible reasons why golf was not as popular among women included the fact that it was quite an expensive activity and that other sports such as cycling \u2018have been marketed more successfully at women\u2019. She added: \u2018In 2015 we have to encourage equality and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be a member at a club where I was treated differently just because I was a woman. \u2018I think a lot of ladies would feel the same in this day and age.\u2019 However, Tory MP Philip Davies said he agreed with Mr Alliss, adding: \u2018This is the consequence of all the legislation. The equality fanatics can\u2019t pick and choose \u2013 they either want full equality or they don\u2019t. If they want full equality then they are going to have to pay the same price as everybody else. \u2018I don\u2019t suppose [Mr Alliss\u2019s] view is outdated. His view is a factual view to be perfectly honest. He is looking at the practicalities of it.\u2019 The Equality Act applies to clubs with mixed memberships. Male-only golf clubs are still legal.

Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA Cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards.

Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches.

{"input": "A photographer has described the horror of being left almost completely blind in one eye by her contact lens. Lucy Garrod, now 27, developed an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion, caused by a bacterial infection which grew under her right lens. Miss Garrod had been wearing contact lenses since she was 15 with no problems, but woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye. Lucy Garrod, 27, was left partially blind in her right eye after bacteria began growing underneath her contact lens, causing an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion . Miss Garrod had worn contact lenses for 12 years with no problem, but woke up one morning feeling as though her eye was 'the size of a golf ball' Miss Garrod feared she would not be able to carry on with her photography degree due to going partially blind in one eye. But she learned to take photographs with her left eye and passed with first class honours . She said it felt like it had swollen to the size of a golf ball, and rushed to see her GP, who prescribed drops. A few days later her eye was still swollen and bloodshot so she went to hospital, where tests revealed the corneal abrasion. Doctors said the ulcer was growing on the surface of her eye, millimetres away from permanently blinding her. She spent a week in hospital, where medics broke the news that she was still partially blind. As a result, she feared she would not be able to complete the last year of her photography degree. Determined not to give up, she taught herself how to take photographs with her left eye, and passed her degree with first class honours. Fortunately, laser eye surgery was later able to restore her sight. Miss Garrod, a freelance photographer living in London, said: 'That day I'd put my lenses in late that morning, but by 4pm my eye was aching. 'It was itchy and usually if you rub it, it was okay. 'But that day I had a sharp shooting pain, the worst I'd ever experienced. 'Two hours later I took my lenses out and removed my make-up, thinking it might be irritating my eye, but there was no relief. Corneal abrasions are a small scratch on the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye. They are generally a result of injury to the surface of the eye. Common causes include a fingernail scratching the eye, walking into something, and getting grit in the eye, particularly if the eye is then rubbed. It can also be caused by certain eye conditions, including trachoma, a bacterial infection. Injuries can also be caused by contact lens being put in and removed from the eye. Abrasions are very painful because there are many nerves that supply the cornea. The pain gets better as your eye heals, but this can take between 24 and 48 hours. If the abrasion involves the central part of your cornea, your vision could also be temporarily affected. Apart from the pain, your eye might be watery, red and sensitive to light. If your eye becomes increasingly red or painful after treatment or your sight becomes much more blurred, see an eye doctor again or contact the hospital. Source: Moorfields Eye Hospital . 'I could close my eye and thought that might take the pain away but it didn't and straining gave me a headache. 'I was awake most of the night.' The next morning Miss Garrod, who is originally from Jersey, looked in the mirror and found her eye was swollen. She said: 'It felt like size of a golf ball. 'My GP said I could have conjunctivitis but I'd had it before. 'It made my eye itchy but this felt worse, painful.' She was given eye drops, which she used for a couple of days until the pain got worse and she went to Beckenham Hospital, where she was given cream to soothe her eyes. However, just two days later her eye was so bloodshot she went back to hospital. Tests showed she had a corneal abrasion, an ulcer on her eye, caused by bacteria getting under her lens. Because her eye was so sensitive she spent a week in a dark room, a nurse coming in every half an hour, 24 hours a day, to give her eyes drops. 'The pain was under control but I was so bored,' she recalled. Next, doctors broke the news that she had lost sight in her right eye, due to the ulcer's position. She said: 'The good news was if the ulcer had been millimetres over I would have lost my sight completely. 'As it was slightly off centre, I would be left partially sighted in that eye. 'But I'd got used to that. My vision had been blurred since my eye first itched.' Miss Garrod was terrified she might not be able to complete the second and third years of her photography degree at Bournemouth University. After she was discharged from hospital she had to learn to use her left eye to take pictures. Previously she had used her right eye to do this, but she couldn't now she was partially sighted in that eye. She was told she would not be able to have laser surgery to fix it as it required cutting a flap in the lens, which was not strong enough for the procedure and would tear. Miss Garrod was forced to spend a week in hospital where nurses put drops in her eye every half an hour for 24 hours. Fortunately, years later she had laser eye surgery to restore the sight in her eye . Miss Garrod struggled with her photography course as she was partially blinded in one eye. She says her friend Bex (left) helped he take notes and assisted her on shoots . A specialist then suggested she could 'piggy back' her lenses, to improve her sight in that eye. It meant wearing a hard lens directly on her eye as a softer one would sink in to the ulcer, then putting a soft lens on top of that. Miss Garrod said: 'I'd have to get used to wearing two lenses so I said, \"I'll just wear glasses.\" For the next month Miss Garrod continued to use the drops and creams she had been given, to help her eye heal. She said: 'My eye was uncomfortable and still watering. 'I struggled with my uni course and had to teach myself how to use my left eye to take photos as my right one was blurry. 'My tutor said I should take a year out but I refused and stuck it out. 'My best friend, who was on my course, helped me take notes and assisted me with photo shoots. Without her I wouldn't have got through it. 'Then my dad found a specialist who suggested a stronger hard lens to improve my sight.' It meant Miss Garrod could complete her degree and gain a first class honours. She wore the hard lenses for the next few years. However the sight in her right eye was still limited and the lenses started to become irritating and uncomfortable. Then, she was referred to the private London Vision Clinic, and told that in fact she could have laser surgery to renew and improve her sight in both eyes. She said: 'As I'd been told before I wouldn't be able to have laser treatment, I thought they wouldn't be able to help.' But Miss Garrod had surgery on both eyes, to improve her left eye so she wouldn't have to wear glasses or lenses. Miss Garrod wore glasses as a young girl (pictured) but had worn contact lenses ever since she was 15 with no problems, until she developed the corneal abrasion that left her partially blind . Next, ultrasound was used to guide a laser to remove the scarred area of her right eye, while preserving the clear tissue underneath, restoring her sight in that eye. She said: 'The surgery was painless and took only a few days to heal. I was nervous but it was over in a minute and I didn't feel a thing. 'Having an infection was rubbish. 'You don't want these things to happen. 'But if it hadn't, there's no way I would have got to the clinic, where the staff were great. 'After I took out my lenses that day I threw them away but if I'd kept them I could have sent them off to find out what the bacteria was and how it caused my infection. 'I find it hard to understand how a contact lens could have damaged my eye so badly. 'I did everything right but still almost lost my sight.' Rising numbers of young people are suffering potentially devastating eye infections due to a lack of knowledge of the risks of contact lenses, say experts.

{"input": "If selected on Sunday, David Templeton will form part of a Rangers guard of honour to recognise the outstanding Championship success of his former club. There will be no feelings of envy as he applauds Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch. Despite enduring much injury-induced frustration in his three seasons in Govan, the winger remains adamant he can prove his worth by rekindling the kind of form he once showed in maroon. Templeton made his first start in almost three months last weekend as Stuart McCall's recorded a 4-1 victory over Cowdenbeath. That followed up a breakthrough win over Hibernian at Easter Road and enhanced confidence ahead of a real litmus test of their recent progress. Rangers ace David Templeton promotes tickets for Sunday's match against Hearts at Ibrox . Hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a Rangers side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play-offs. This wasn't a scenario Templeton could ever have envisaged when he moved west along the M8 in August 2012, away from Vladimir Romanov's teetering reign that would eventually lapse into administration. Back then, Rangers were just starting to emerge from their own, even deeper, financial meltdown of liquidation. Few predicted any on-field problems in their journey back up the leagues. Rangers' Haris Vuckic & Nicky Clark training at Murray Park ahead of the clash with Hearts . This season has told a very different story. Templeton, though, insists he has had no regretful thoughts of what it would be like to somehow still be a Hearts player. 'No, because I think I would have been away the following season anyway,' he said. 'At the time I moved, it was the right time for me, I was kind of forced out, as well. 'It was just one of those things, it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play-offs then I still think it would have been a good move. Rangers' Tom Walsh training at Murray Park ahead of their clash with runaway leaders Hearts . 'It's massive that we do that. When I signed for Rangers with the squad we had, I thought we would go up each year. For us as a club - and the supporters and everyone - it's massive to get back to the top league. 'My time here has been pretty frustrating, personally. The first season I really enjoyed, although I picked up a couple of injuries which didn't help. 'Last season, I had a couple of little niggles pre-season and then I didn't play a lot. This season, the exact same. Hopefully now I can keep myself fit and start afresh if we go up.' Rangers captain Lee McCulloch holds the ball up as his teammates look on during a training session . Templeton is not among the dozen or so first-team players out of contract this summer, with 12 months still left on his deal. 'The fans have definitely not seen the best of me,' he admitted. 'I need to get back playing the way I was before I signed here because that was the reason I signed for Rangers. 'I know that I'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me.' Rangers trialists Milos Milovic (left) and Josef Shirdel (right) are put through their paces during training . Templeton on Friday lauded the difference McCall has made since his arrival last month. The 26-year-old claimed he now felt more confident about expressing himself on the field. 'Earlier in the season, I played a few games and didn't do too well, but at the same time the team wasn't doing as well either and it's hard to stand out then,' he said. 'Last Saturday we were really attacking and creating a load of chances which made me feel a lot better, a lot more confident. The manager has given me the confidence as well since he has come in. Rangers' Lee Wallace tests his reaction speeds as he is put through his paces during training . 'Even before I'm going on in games, he'll just tell me to stay wide, get the ball and attack. It doesn't matter how many times I lose it in the final third, but just to try and make things happen. As a winger, that's what you like to hear - that you're not going to be criticised for trying to do the right things.' Hearts have won both previous matches against Rangers this term but Templeton believes the gap in those games was not significant. 'The past few times we have played Hearts we didn't actually do too badly,' he added. 'In the first game of the season we should have won it - I missed a sitter at 0-0 and if I had scored it we would have gone on to win the game. Templeton holds the ball up as a Rangers teammate looks to dispossess him during a training session . 'The second game, we started well and they couldn't get out of their half. But then we had a man sent off which didn't help us. 'It will be good to play against them on Sunday. They have been excellent this season and thoroughly deserved to win the title. But we will work on how we will play and I am sure we will all be ready.' McCall is dismissive of any suggestion that Hearts might somehow slacken off having already secured a Premiership return. Hearts' Jordan McGhee (right) speaks with teammate Callum Paterson at training ahead of their game . 'If you have won nine on the bounce and you are champions then you are going to have a lot of confidence,' insisted the Ibrox boss. 'Every one of their players will have that. They also have a real good spirit. 'It is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test. Going down to Queen of the South on Thursday will be tough. 'But I take the point that people will look at the Hearts game and think it might be a barometer of how far we have come. The Hearts squad train at Tynecastle ahead of their fixture with Rangers on Sunday . 'We have improved each game and that is all we are asking for again. But we will slip up between now and the end of the season, no doubt. We won't win every game. 'There will be ups and downs but it is about how we handle it. There is a little bit of belief back in the players again, but we know it is only two wins.

Ben Hiscox, 30, was playing a home game for Stoke Gifford United in Bristol on Saturday when he slipped on the wet ground following the tackle and crashed into the building. The striker was knocked unconscious and rushed to intensive care for urgent treatment.\u00a0But, three days later, he suffered two seizures and died in hospital. Tragic: Ben Hiscox, 30, (pictured left and right with a teammate) died yesterday, three days after hitting his head on the clubhouse wall during a home football match at Stoke Gifford United in Bristol . His team-mates had gone to secure a 4-1 victory against Mangotsfields Sports, not realising their fellow player had been fatally injured. The defender involved in the tackle was too shaken to carry on playing, the club said. Tributes have since flooded in for Mr Hiscox, who was described by his club as a 'total legend'. Close friend and club vice-chairman Ben Bennett said: 'No one is blaming anyone. It was just a tragic accident.' The incident unfolded about 55 minutes into the game as Mr Hiscox and his opponent both charged down the right wing towards the ball. As Mr Hiscox crossed the ball into the box, he was tackled by the defender and hit the floor. He then slid into the clubhouse, where his head which thrown backwards against the wall. Mr Bennett said Mr Hiscox was knocked unconscious for five minutes but managed to move himself away from the pitch. Four ambulances then rushed to the scene to take him to Southmead hospital, Bristol. In hospital, Mr Hiscox was given medication to sedate him and, by Monday, was showing signs of improvement.

Mr Bennett, 33, said: 'He was a big part of the club and the team here. 'He had been part of the club for a long time, since he was about 16. He was a total legend and one of the nicest guys I have ever met. 'Everyone that met him liked him. He was one of the nicest blokes you could know. No one had a bad word to say about him.

{"input": "An unknown Englishman playing in his first PGA Tour event will have the chance to complete an unbelievable fairytale at the Shell Houston Open on Sunday and earn the most unlikely invitation to the Masters. Surrey-born Kelvin Day has only played a handful of events on the subsidiary circuit, the Web.com Tour but decided to enter qualifying for the Houston event. This is a real 36 hole lottery where 131 players were fighting for the final four spots. With two excellent rounds of 64, the 27-year-old finished tied first to earn his place \u2013 and how he has taken advantage. It was a decent achievement in itself to make the halfway cut, and it earned him a third round draw alongside two rather more famous Englishmen in Paul Casey and Justin Rose. Kelvin Day is three shots behind the leaders and remains in with a chance of making the Masters . Day, however, refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy, bogey-free scorecard to match the 68 shot by Casey and upstage Rose, who shot 72. Incredibly, that has left Day alongside Casey in tied sixth place, just three shots off the lead held, almost inevitably, by the remarkably consistent young American, Jordan Spieth. Realistically, a top ten finish would be a fine achievement for Day, which would earn him a place in the field for the tournament after the Masters, the Heritage in South Carolina. But it is worth bearing in mind that a victory would not only earn him a PGA Tour card but the last spot in the field for Augusta. Wouldn\u2019t that be some story? Casey only learned he was in the field for the Masters himself last Sunday, and is continuing his welcome revival this season with another good showing. He is a former winner of this event and again showed his liking for the course. Record crowds descended on the Houston suburb of Humble to watch the great crowd pleaser Phil Mickelson, who began one off the halfway lead and the newest Texan golfing hero, Spieth. Jordan Spieth leads the way in Houston . But while the latter delivered with a 67 to lead the way on 14 under, Mickelson could only muster a 75 to tumble down the leaderboard. It\u2019s amazing to think it\u2019s only 18 months since Spieth was attracting heavy criticism for dropping out of college to take his place on the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. While his former university classmates are studying hard for their final exams, 21 year old Spieth might be said to have passed his own particular exam with flying colours, since he has risen to fourth in the world and will go second behind Rory McIlroy should he claim this title on Sunday. He would also take his earnings over those 18 months to almost $12 million. Funnily enough, he\u2019s not attracting criticism anymore. Spieth, watched by his parents and younger sister Ellie, hass a one stroke advantage over a trio of lesser-known countrymen \u2013 Scott Piercy, former Houston champion Jason Wagner and Austin Cook. \u2018I\u2019ve got a lot of friends as well as my family in the gallery and I shall certainly be trying to win for them on Sunday,\u2019 said Spieth. If he did that it would be his fourth victory in his last nine starts and underline his status as one of the favourites to win the green jacket. Spieth finished runner-up behind Bubba Watson on his Masters debut last year. Like Day, 24 year old Cook is trying to write an astonishing story of his own. He just happens to be the Monday qualifier who tied Day for first place. As for Mickelson, his poor form over the past few months caught up with him on Saturday after opening rounds of 66 and 67 had raised hopes he was close to his best. The 44 year old fell apart over the closing stretch, registering four bogeys in his last five holes.", "answer": "Kelvin Day, from Surrey, has played a handful of events on Web.com Tour .\nHe entered the qualifying for the Houston Open and finished tied first .\nHe then made the cut and is now three shots off the lead .\nVictory for Day would earn him a place in the Masters field .", "completion": ["English golfer Kelvin Day, playing in his first PGA Tour event, has a chance to earn an invitation to the Masters at the Shell Houston Open, currently standing just three shots off the lead."]}
{"input": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs . Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise)\u00a0Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and\u00a0Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call . Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters . A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches.

{"input": "A young Irish rugby star escaped serious injury when his home was targeted by a gunman who fired multiple bullets through his windows. Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s and recently played in their Six Nations campaign, was not at his home in Cromkill in County Antrim, Northern Ireland when it was targeted on Easter Sunday. Shocked neighbours said he could have been killed if he was in the property, after bullets tore through the windows and ended up embedded in the kitchen and bathroom walls. Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s (left), was not at home when a gunman fired multiple bullets through the windows of his property in County Antrim, Northern Ireland (right) on Sunday . Mr McBurney, who lives at the home with his brother Shane, 20, and is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby, is said to have returned to the house following the attack but is yet to speak about the incident. Photographs from the scene today show at least 12 bullet holes still visible in a living room window of the property, which is situated on a small housing estate alongside just seven other homes. Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of shots were fired at the windows of the unoccupied house at 2.20am on Sunday. Detectives are now appealing for witnesses and said the incident had 'criminal elements'. Officers also said a red Honda Accord car, which is believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt-out in a nearby road shortly after the attack. Chief inspector Natalie Wilson said: 'This type of attack is totally unacceptable and there is no place for this type of activity in a civilised society. I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible. 'I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights. 'We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible.' Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which occurred when the house was unoccupied in the early hours of Easter Sunday. Investigators' markings showed at least 12 bullets hit one window of the house . Mr McBurney, who lives at the home on a quiet residental street in County Antrim with his brother Shane, 20, is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby and played in\u00a0Ireland U20's game vs France U20's (pictured above) One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as 'very worrying'. He told Belfast Live: 'It is fortunate the boys were not at home when these shots were fired into the living room because with that amount of shots flying about we very well could be talking about the death of one or two brothers, one of whom is one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland.' Adam McBurney is deemed one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland and there are hopes he will play internationally. The young player grew up playing for his local club Ballymena, and has also been associated with Randalstown RFC. He has since gone on to represent Ulster and Ireland and has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s \u2013 playing recently against Italy and France in their Six Nations campaign. He is also actively involved with the Belfast Met Rugby Academy- which blends intense professional rugby training with academic courses. Alongside rugby, McBurney works at Tullyglass House Hotel - an imposing country residence set in its own grounds on the outskirts of Ballymena. Another neighbour, Marie McKeown, 77, added: 'I heard the bangs and at first I didn't realise what it was. It woke me up. 'This is a very quiet area. I would be a light sleeper and I heard bang, bang, bang. I was shocked when I heard this happening. I hope it quietens down.' Following the attack, police cordoned off part of the housing estate and increased patrols in the area. It is believed, from the bullet casings found at the scene, that a nine-mm type weapon was fired with twelve rounds hitting the living room window and its frame. A further two strike marks were visible on the wall above the window. Bullets lodged in the kitchen and in the bathroom walls suggest that anyone who might have been in either room at the time of the shooting would most likely have been killed or suffered serious injury. Mr McBurney, who played for his local rugby club Ballymena before going on to represent Ulster and Ireland, inherited the property with his brother when their mother Heather died in December 2013.

Charlie Hodgson kicked two first-half penalties \u2013 either side of a 27th minute try for Maxime Machenaud after Saracens lost an attacking scrum - Jim Hamilton was shown a yellow card, the tourists were fortunate to go into the break with a one-point advantage. \u2018We weren't great in the first half, even though we had a very strong wind,\u2019 said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. \u2018We were unable to build any pressure. Playing into that very strong wind and with Jonny Sexton playing No 10 for the opposition, being 6-5 up at half time felt like a mountain to climb. Marcelo Bosch is an Argentine utility\u00a0back who moved to Europe in 2006 to\u00a0play for Biarritz. He joined Saracens in\u00a0the 2013-14 season and has featured\u00a0predominantly at centre. He is not Saracens\u2019 first-choice kicker -\u00a0Owen Farrell, Charlie Hodgson and Alex\u00a0Goode are all above him - but he has a\u00a0hugely powerful strike. It\u2019s earned him cult status with the\u00a0Allianz Park crowd, who chant \u2018Bosch,\u00a0Bosch, Bosch\u2019 whenever he lines up one\u00a0of his kicks. As a teenager, Bosch played football in\u00a0Buenos Aires but claims that it was always\u00a0his dream to play rugby in England. He\u00a0married Augustina last summer and they are expecting twins.

Strettle is upended going for a high ball against Racing's Brice Dulin, who escapes a yellow card . \u2018But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. We went hunting and kept knocking them down, scrapping for absolutely everything. Our rugby could have been better and it wasn't a beauty of a match, but we put them under enough pressure to make some errors and give us a chance.\u2019 Cigarette smoke filled the air and, having never previously progressed from the pool stages, the hosts looked like they were choking on the pressure. Racing did most of the running but Saracens edged further ahead, with Goode also adding his weight to the kicking with a 47th minute penalty. Wales and Racing centre Jamie Roberts threatened in attack, but was hauled off in the 52nd minute. Bosch then tackled his countryman Juan Imhoff just short of the line \u2013 although the pitch-length move was subsequently pulled back for a forward pass \u2013 and Billy Vunipola intervened with a crucial turnover to snuff out a Racing attack. But Saracens were unable to build upon their lead and, just past the hour mark, Racing narrowed the gap thanks to three points from Machenaud. A game of kick tennis ensued and the French No 9 pushed his side into the lead with his second penalty 10 minutes later. The blue and white flags were waving and the bass drum was beating but, sacrebleu, Metro tried to run down the clock. Then Metz came flying off his feet at the crucial moment. Bosch stepped up for the penalty and, after a short run up, his kick floated gracefully between the sticks.

{"input": "Officially it's known as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike' but unofficially it's the 'firework' and Tom Daley hopes it's the dive that turns London bronze into Rio gold. The former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his 'demon' dive, a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference. However, along with new coach Jane Figueiredo he spent the winter modifying a new plunge, something that has never been attempted before. Daley spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights. Tom Daley hopes his new 'firework' dive can help win Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio de Janiero Games . It was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the British Championships and was part of Daley's repertoire when he won silver, with a personal best score, at the recent World Diving Series in Dubai. 'There was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something,' admitted Daley. 'The old dive did terrify me and while I did conquer my demons with it, it's a weight off my shoulders that I've moved on because it was a bad dive for me. 'We wanted to do the least twist possible because I hate the twisting part. We've only got one twist in this dive so we had to decide whether we were going to do it at the beginning or at the end because you can do that dive three different ways. 'We tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the G-force getting into your pike shape is really difficult. 'We go through 20 Gs of force as we're spinning around so at the end we decided to do it on the way out. So you spin as fast as you can and then you come out at the end, do one twist then land in the water.' Daley (right) has spent\u00a0the winter modifying the plunge with his\u00a0new coach Jane Figueiredo . It's six years since Daley won his breakthrough world title in Rome, one year after making his Olympic debut as a 14-year old in Beijing. Last year there were inaccurate reports that Daley was to call time on his diving career but he insists he's enjoying the sport more than ever, following the decision to relocate from Plymouth to London. His home pool is now the Olympic pool, a place with happy memories, and he'll be the star attraction at next month's FINA Diving World Series, 1-3 May in his newly-adopted hometown. But Daley is no longer the sole standard bearer for British diving, Jack Laugher became the first non-Chinese diver to win on the World Series this year in Dubai and Tonia Couch and synchro partner Sarah Barrow are also established among the world's elite. 'I have never loved diving as much as I do now and I want to stay in diving for as long as I possibly can,' added Daley. The 20-year-old says he is enjoying diving more than ever after relocating from Plymouth to London . 'With the move to London it has become exciting again. Especially with the new dive, there are new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. 'It's been great having Jane on board, we've had a year and three months working together now. 'There's little things that we've changed \u2013 the strength and conditioning, the way that we work in the pool, the way we work in the gym but it's really working out. 'British diving is the strongest it's ever been and we are all really excited about coming back to London and competing in our own pool. 'We know in London that we always get a crowd that's loud. It's normally a sell-out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else, it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and, in theory, it should get us to dive a little bit better.' And Daley hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month's FINA Diving World Series in London . But Daley's key ambition for the season in this summer's World Championships in Kazan. Since striking gold in Rome, he has settled for a fifth and sixth at the event, a record he concedes must change. His rivals will be the normal suspects, reigning champion Qiu Bo, Olympic champion David Boudia and Germany's Sascha Klein. 'The build up to Rio is going pretty well,' he added. 'It's got a lot of competitions leading up to it and the worlds will be our first chance to qualify. 'London is one of the key parts of the diving calendar this year because it's the middle part of the World Series. So it's a really good marker to see how the new dive's going and how all of that is piecing together and it's exactly the half-way mark competition wise so I'm really looking forward to it.'

Higginbotham and his Black Cats team-mates were about to take on Aston Villa during the 2007-08 Premier League season when Keane sat them down in the home changing room at the Stadium of Light. But instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them, the former Manchester United midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk.

Keane watches his Sunderland players in action against Aston Villa after delivering his 'bizarre' team talk . Danny Higginbotham (right) gave struggling Sunderland the lead during the game on December 15, 2007 . In his new autobiography Rise Of The Underdog: My Life Inside Football, Higginbotham - who scored in Sunderland's 1-1 draw with Villa that day - describes Keane's attempt to motivate his players. '''Listen lads,' he said. 'Basically you're s***. Try and enjoy the game. You're probably going to get beat. But just enjoy being s***.\" 'Then he just walked out. Those words have got to be insulting to any professional, no matter who they come from, and I'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong. I scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time. We ended up drawing.' Higginbotham also reveals how Keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them.

That's all I'm hearing.\" I thought, well, that's not so bad. \"I don't f****** want that. I want you to tell some of them they're being c****. Tell them.''' Despite a 2-0 loss away at Bolton in the season's penultimate game, Sunderland secured their Premier League safety with a match to spare. But although he had helped ensure another year in England's top-flight, Keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against Gary Megson's side. Higginbotham (left) now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in January, 2014 . Reliving his manager's post-match team talk, Higginbotham writes: '''You're the reason I'm driving up and down the f****** country to find another player, you're not f****** good enough,\" he yells at one player. '\"Your attitude is s***. You're not good enough,\" he bawls at others. '\"Next week we've got our last home game, against Arsenal.

He told the Independent: 'We tried to think what went wrong for us last season, especially when we got beaten heavily by those big teams. Very severe. 'It's always a big discussion. I mean, we are responsible for our performances. No one wants to have such a miserable day again.' 'You need that arguing culture. We lost that at times.

{"input": "Quiz question. Which player is the second-highest scorer in the country this season? Stand up and take a bow anyone who came up with Benik Afobe, who was one of Arsenal\u2019s own before they loaned him to MK Dons and sold him to Wolves. Afobe is young, electric-paced and on 28 goals this season - one behind man-of-the-moment Harry Kane of Tottenham and England.

Goals: Afobe 46, Sako 72 . Booked: Price . Ref: Andy D\u2019Urso 6 . Man of the match: Afobe . If he keeps this up, Afobe might even be able to inspire Wolves all the way into the Premier League. What a bargain for \u00a32million, too. Having scored 19 times for MK, the 22-year-old striker has nine goals in 15 appearances for Kenny Jackett\u2019s Wanderers. He has a goalscoring knack, beautifully illustrated 30 seconds into the second half when he collected the ball round the centre circle and started running. Back-tracking Forest defenders held off and held off until, boom, Afobe took a pot-shot and Karl Darlow retrieved the ball which had just avoided his finger tips. Suddenly a tight, strangely underwhelming, match, had a breakthrough and Wolves duly capitalised on it as Bakary Sako doubled the lead from the penalty spot. They are building up a head of steam as the Skybet Championship enters the final weeks with one defeat in nine. Jackett has steered his team from the blind side with remarkable efficiency. A trip across to the East Midlands could have been a very tricky encounter considering Forest\u2019s resurgence under Dougie Freeman. The news that owner Fawaz al Hasawi wants Freedman to stay beyond the summer hardly comes as a surprise. More importantly, from the supporters\u2019 point of view, the manager is making all the right noises about triggering his year\u2019s option too. The Freedman effect is tangible at the City Ground, even if this turned out to be the first real blip. Henri Lansbury has been back to something like his best after a forgettable first chunk of the season so this was a step back for him, too. If anything illustrates BP and AP \u2013 before and after Stuart Pearce \u2013 then it is Lansbury\u2019s match stats. Before Pearce\u2019s sacking Lansbury had 10 yellow cards and five goals to his name. Since then he has picked up one more booking and scored seven times. Admittedly he went into this Midlands derby on the back of a six-match goal drought and it was his clumsy challenge on Sako which had referee Andy D\u2019Urso pointing to the spot.

Gary Gardner attempts a scissor kick as Forest look to breach the Wolves defence . A bad day at the office, then, for Forest. Maths and time is against them making the top six but beating Wolves would have had the double impact of keeping them in the chasing pack and denting the top-six hopes of Kenny Jackett\u2019s team. Certainly the 27,000 bumper Good Friday crowd who braved the drizzle arrived in hope and expectation because Freedman\u2019s other achievement since his arrival has been a transformation of home results. Five straight victories at the City Ground after a similar winless run had injected optimism. By the final whistle there were resigned expressions on faces again despite a 90th minute consolation from Dexter Blackstock. Yet it had started promisingly. Michail Antonio might have scored in the opening minutes although it would have been a fluke. The Forest attacker blocked Carl Ikeme\u2019s clearance and the ball ballooned up and could have gone anywhere.

The Wolves striker (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . The home side also had their \u2018A\u2019 man and, like Afobe there is an Arsenal connection. Chuba Akpom was on the wanted list of many clubs in January but Forest managed to persuade the Gunners to loan him out to them. He was named from the start but struggled to impose himself. His best moment was a penalty claim when he went down under a challenge from Chris Burke but D\u2019Urso was having none of it. Highlights for Forest included a long-range effort by Michael Mancienne which was pushed wide by Ikeme while Lansbury shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Wolves thought they had scored in the first half when Kevin Wilson\u2019s slip let in Afobe. Darlow saved the shot and Eric Lichaj blocked the follow-up by Nouha Dicko.

{"input": "Almost two weeks on from Liverpool\u2019s wretched afternoon against Manchester United at Anfield, it would appear that lessons have already been learned. Asked about a setback that may yet cost Brendan Rodgers and his players a place in next season\u2019s Champions League, the club\u2019s midfielder Joe Allen was rueful. \u2018They were ready to go and maybe we weren\u2019t,\u2019 Allen told a young supporter at Melwood this week. \u2018Yeah, maybe the rivalry can sometimes get in the way.\u2019 Joe Allen battles it out with Ander Herrera during Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Man United at Anfield . Liverpool midfielder Allen spoke to Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman at Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Midfielder Allen believes Liverpool have performed well against the big teams during the last two seasons . For Allen, and indeed for Liverpool, one suspects that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed as merely another kink in the road. Certainly there is nobody at Anfield who will accept the opinion offered by Sky Sports\u2019 Gary Neville, the former United defender, that Liverpool froze. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem,\u2019 said Allen. \u2018I think over the last two seasons we have performed against the big teams. Games can just be like that sometimes. It doesn\u2019t happen very often. Next time that game comes around we will get it right.\u2019 Over the past few months at Liverpool there has certainly been more right than wrong. Going into Saturday\u2019s game at Arsenal, they are five points off fourth place in the Barclays Premier League but that still represents progress from the dark days of autumn and early winter. Allen, one senses, has been integral to recent improvement. With captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic starter and the Brazilian Lucas Leiva recently injured, the 25-year-old midfielder has been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth. Allen has been given an opportunity  with captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic choice for Liverpool . While Gerrard is no longer the first name on the teamsheet, Lucas Leiva (left) has also been sidelined . Having arrived with Rodgers from Swansea in 2012, Allen could not always be relied on. He admitted this week that at times the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hopes that recent performances in big victories against Manchester City, Southampton and Swansea will one day be seen as evidence of a genuine breakthrough. \u2018I think so, I hope so,\u2019 Allen told Sportsmail. \u2018Personally I have always been confident that I just needed games. \u2018I will be open and honest, though. In my first season there were moments when I look back and am disappointed about how I did cope with that [mental] aspect of things. \u2018Maybe I underestimated it a little bit before I came. I tried to anticipate it but you can\u2019t do it until you get here. Now I have come through that and the only issue this season has been injuries. Hopefully I can stay fit now and show people the best of me.\u2019 Allen\u2019s increased standing at Liverpool saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporters this week. Guest of honour was Sean Melia, a volunteer at the Anfield Sports Community Centre who was present at Melwood as a \u2018Barclays spirit of the game hero\u2019. During a 20-minute Q&A with a group of supporters, Allen talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when Gerrard announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season\u2019s title failure. \u2018We understand that we gave it to Manchester City,\u2019 he said. Allen admits, at times, the challenge of playing for Liverpool felt a little too big but has impressed recently . Gerrard consoles Luis Suarez as Liverpool's title hopes were dented against Crystal Palace last season . Allen also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain Gerrard announced he would be leaving the Reds . Later on, however, his conversation with Sportsmail was more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother Harry, a talented footballer who plays for the Wales deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis as a toddler. \u2018When we were younger, he was a striker and he was a better player than me,\u2019 revealed Allen. \u2018At primary school I played with him and his mates and that gave me a little bit of a head start as they were two years older. \u2018He is profoundly deaf but he speaks so well. I used to sign a little bit but he communicates so well now that I don\u2019t need to. \u2018Sibling rivalry is the perfect description of what we had, though. We loved playing against each other but there was a competitive edge to it. It\u2019s a while back but I guess that is where the path all started for me. \u2018It\u2019s hard to say whether he would have made it - it is something that I do wonder about. But going out on to the pitch profoundly deaf is a huge disadvantage. So I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those that we will never know the answer to\u2026\u2019 Home these days for Allen is the house he shares in Chester with his wife Lacey and son Alfie. Inherently private, he was a little embarrassed when Lacey posted a photograph on Twitter of last year\u2019s birthday present. Then again a photograph of a top footballer holding a live chicken is rather unusual. Allen poses with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the Liverpool midfielder's 24th Birthday .

It has got a name but I\u2019m not telling you! We already had a couple of chickens and this is a cockerel. That was the point of it really. In the dressing room, it\u2019s a bit of a random one. \u2018I keep my private life private and I guess that was a rare insight. We didn\u2019t realise what impact it would have but it was harmless enough.\u2019 Allen was rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and, in particular, Wales\u2019s weekend win in Israel that left Chris Coleman\u2019s team at the top of their qualifying group for Euro 2016.Allen was in Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium in 2004 when Mark Hughes\u2019s team lost a play-off to Russia. Now he wants to make some history with his country and finish off the work started by one of his early national coaches, the late Gary Speed. Allen is keen to make history with Wales and finish the work started by former manager, the late Gary Speed . \u2018His presence is still there for everyone,\u2019 Allen said poignantly. \u2018He began this journey for us and his big dream was for us to qualify. In lots of ways we want to make sure we can do this for someone like Gary. \u2018He was a real people person. For a young midfielder going into the squad, he certainly had a huge impact on my career. \u2018It was a huge win for us in Israel and we have a great chance now. For me it was the perfect thing to happen after the Man United result. \u2018That\u2019s the beauty of football. There is always the next game to put things right.\u2019 Allen played in the 3-0 win over Israel which took Wales to their top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group . Domestically, Liverpool\u2019s opportunity to make amends begins at the Emirates tomorrow and continues in Lancashire next Wednesday with an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn. There is still much to aim for at Anfield this season and, with Gerrard suspended for three games, opportunity continues to knock for one of the next generation. \u2018Whatever happened in one game has gone,\u2019 said Allen. \u2018We can start another run and do it again. That has to be our belief and confidence now. \u2018Last season we had a similar run. We have to use that to inspire us. If the teams above us do slip up then we will be waiting.\u2019 Joe Allen was speaking at a Barclays event to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the game.

But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday.

I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.'

Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet.

{"input": "As Brendan Rodgers sat down to have his say on Thursday, it was easy to forget that Liverpool have a critical game against their top-four rivals Arsenal on Saturday. Instead, there was only one issue on the agenda, brought about by Raheem Sterling's television interview 24 hours earlier. The interview in which he suddenly seemed happy to discuss that unsigned \u00a3100,000-a-week contract, assert he is a trophy-hunter rather than a money-grabber and, perhaps most alarming of all, admit he is flattered by interest from Saturday's opponents from north London.

Sterling appeared to give his manager a pat on the back as they talked during training . Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's match with Arsenal . Instead of talking about the race for a Champions League pot of gold, Rodgers found himself again discussing the subject of Sterling's silver. The response seemed well prepared, a message of solidarity combined with a show of strength. Sterling is going nowhere was the emphatic statement. And if there were any suggestion from the 20-year-old that Liverpool need to convince him they can match his ambition, the message from Rodgers was equally clear: count yourself lucky to be here. 'Arsenal is a fantastic football club, of course, but this is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world,' said the Anfield boss . 'It's an honour for Raheem to play here at a club like Liverpool in front of our great supporters and he understands that. He sees that. 'If Raheem has said his ambition is to win trophies and be successful, then it's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do.' There was a reminder to Sterling and his representatives that his stock has risen on the back of the work Liverpool have done with him and the faith Rodgers has placed in the player. He is, Rodgers remarked, not yet the finished article. Not yet of the same calibre as Luis Suarez who eventually got his move away from Merseyside. Sterling admitted he was 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal as his contract talks are put on hold . Sterling and Daniel Sturridge share a joke on the training ground during Thursday morning's session . The players were in a relaxed mood despite the continued speculation over Sterling's future at the club . The England international cast doubt on his Liverpool future in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday . 'Now, as a 20-year-old, no he's not at that level,' said Rodgers. 'Raheem has been involved with the first team for two-and-a-half years and the player he is today \u2014 and he still has a lot of improvements to make \u2014 is because of the environment and what we've created here. 'He's still got learning and development to make on and off the pitch. We feel this is a great place for him. We'll very much focus on trying to make him the best player we can. 'He's a young player who has developed a lot and that's because of one reason, which is Liverpool. So we're quite relaxed on that and we'll concentrate on his football, hopefully. 'For us it's really about continuing to nurture the development of a young player who has made huge strides and someone who we believe we still have a lot of input into his development to come so he can be consistently a player playing at the top of his game.' There is a growing feeling that Sterling and his representatives are attempting to force Liverpool's hand here and orchestrate a move back to London, where Arsenal and Chelsea would welcome him home with open arms. Certainly the mixed messages over the contract stalemate in recent months have been confusing. Is it about money? Is it about trophies? Is it about Sterling's best position?

Sterling and Emre Can leap during one of the training ground exercises on Thursday morning . Sterling takes his turn on the ladders as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's vital match against Arsenal . The latter, according to Rodgers, should not be an issue. Most important of all is that Sterling is a first-team regular getting the kind of opportunities that young players do not elsewhere. The manager drew comparisons with Steven Gerrard. 'Every player will have a position to play,' he said. 'I pick the best team and what is key for him \u2014 and I'm sure he understands \u2014 is that he's getting the opportunity to play. 'If you look through this league and in Europe, there aren't many playing at 17, 18, 19 or 20. 'Every player will want to play but he only needs to look at Steven Gerrard in his time here. He played in a back three, as a wing back, right back, left back, central midfield, as a No 10. 'It doesn't bother me. I pick the best team and he will probably sit back, reflect and think he is playing, which not many young kids are. 'He's a boy who genuinely loves his football. He's played all over the field for me but he understands and respects the opportunity that he's had to play all over the field. It's been great for him and his career.' Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football . Liverpool find themselves five points behind Manchester United in the battle for the top four places . Rodgers organises the footballs during Liverpool's Thursday morning training session . There is little doubt that Sterling's interview has been unhelpful in the extreme, but there remains a determination at Anfield to keep the player onside and head off a contract crisis. To that end, Rodgers struck a conciliatory tone on Thursday. 'We speak regularly with Raheem and I just see him work and work well,' Rodgers said. 'He's been injured and there is probably a bit of frustration there because he's not been totally clear and he's a boy who just loves to play, train and be on the field. 'You have seen what can happen with players and representatives, but I can only speak openly and honestly with Raheem. He has made it clear he is happy and hopefully he can do his talking on the field. 'My concentration is on working with the player. He is a young man. He has had trauma in his life and he is a tough boy and you see that in how he plays, but he is still very young. He still needs guidance and help \u2014 that is pretty clear.'

De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around \u00a310million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday.

Warning:\u00a0MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain\u2019s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: \u2018British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. \u2018There is no testing regarding mental health.\u2019 A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information \u2013 such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden \u2013 process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: \u2018Years ago, the emphasis was on external security.

Bowyer, who has a lengthy injury list at his Championship club, wanted to include 21-year-old midfielder John O'Sullivan to face The Reds having recalled him from a loan spell with League One Barnsley last month.

{"input": "This was as far away from the Ashes cauldron as it is possible to be but a quiet day of run scoring against sub-standard opposition in picturesque Basseterre at the start of England\u2019s Caribbean tour meant everything to Jonathan Trott. It must have seemed to Trott that he would never again bat for England when he suffered that brutal dismantling at the hands of Mitchell Johnson during England\u2019s ill-fated last Ashes tour almost 18 months ago. Yet here he was, recovered from the mental condition that forced his departure from Australia and now certain of a new role opening the batting in the first Test in Antigua next week. It is quite a comeback. Jonathan Trott and Alastair Cook combine impressively as England produce dominant display . Cook plays behind square as wicketkeeper Jaison Peters  looks on in Basseterre, St Kitts . If Trott\u2019s return with 72 was the most pleasing aspect of a dominant day for England then an unbeaten 95 for captain Alastair Cook was almost as important. The pair came together here at the top of the order yesterday for the first time since a brief experiment in Bangladesh five years ago in what was a low-key return to work after the embarrassment of England\u2019s first round World Cup exit. Neither Cook nor Trott could be blamed for that nor for the careful way they went about their batting in this two-day practice match against a St Kitts Invitational XI that would struggle to defeat a decent English club side. Stuart Broad bowls in the Carribean sun as England take on a\u00a0St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . Such was the scale of England\u2019s World Cup embarrassment that they find themselves very much on trial again now even though they ended last year\u2019s Test summer with three successive wins against India. The failure of Sam Robson to convince alongside Cook has opened the door for the return of Trott ahead of Adam Lyth and he made the most of his chance in a stand of 158 with his captain made in the most comfortable of circumstances. England had barely broken sweat in bowling St Kitts out for 59, another returnee in Ben Stokes taking three wickets in five balls, before Cook and Trott overwhelmed a local side who had bizarrely warmed up in Inter Milan shirts. Perhaps they are better at football than cricket because there was little to concern two players with much to prove for different reasons in Cook and Trott. The captain is back after being demoted from one-day office and looked the more fluent, despatching anything short and moving on to his 50 off 95 balls to follow the three half-centuries he has scored in his last four Test innings. Trott was the only casualty of the day for England and he had to be almost dragged from the crease when he was eventually caught at short leg. \u2018It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s never been away,\u2019 said Stokes. \u2018It was really good to see the way he just settled back to how he has been over the last few years.\u2019 Quite how much the England attack got out of their morning work-out was questionable because this was a shockingly indisciplined batting display from a St Kitts side who included just seven players with first-class experience. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad eased their way back after their own humbling World Cups but the most penetrative bowling came from Stokes, who swung the ball consistently on a typically slow and flat Warner Park pitch. England batsmen Cook\u00a0plays to the leg side during the West Indies Tour match against\u00a0St Kitts and Nevis XI .

Stokes and Chris Jordan are clearly ahead of Liam Plunkett and the newcomer Mark Wood in the pecking order while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell appear to be competing for the solitary spinner\u2019s place next week.

Although they sit six points clear at the top of the league with a game in hand on all their nearest rivals, Mourinho still believes that there is still a four-horse race for the title this season. 'Look at the points difference,' he said. 'You have to say four (teams) now. Not five, because there's a gap from fourth to fifth and, with eight matches to go, that's a difficult gap from first to fifth. 'But the points difference between second, third and fourth makes me think and feel that they are there.' He added: 'We need six victories and one draw from nine matches. It is a good situation for us, and one all the other clubs would like to have. But it's pure mathematics. We need to win six matches and draw one. We need to do that, and we haven't done it yet.' And despite Manchester United's inconsistency this season, Mourinho still believes Louis van Gaal's side are still in with a shot at the title. 'The number of the points is the number of points,' Mourinho added. 'They are there. The points are there.

Darren Gough, Kevin Pietersen's close friend, says his pal only has a small chance of returning for England . Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . But Gough believes there is still only a slim chance of his friend adding to his tally of 104 Test match appearances when England start their Ashes series on the same ground a few months later. 'I would say it's a pretty small percentage chance of seeing Kevin playing for England again,' said Gough, who is taking part in the second Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for the Lord's Taverners in July, the UK's leading youth cricket and disability sports charity, with the inaugural event raising over \u00a3280,000 for the Lord's Taverners and other charities in 2013 .

With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player\u2019s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal\u2019s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling  goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth \u00a3100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: \u2018I\u2019ve had a good chat with him.

A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. \u2018You don\u2019t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he\u2019s asked to do that by other parties then that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do. \u2018In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.\u2019 Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth \u00a3100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . \u2018In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem\u2019s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. \u2018I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different.

It is the model of Liverpool, which the owners have put in, where they want to create the world class talent. He has just turned 20. There is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential. I believe that will be developed over the next coming years at Liverpool. \u2018It is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that.

With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for \u00a32million in January.

He drove onto a lose ball in the West Bromwich Albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper. Earlier, in the 84th minute, he received a forearm in the face from substitute Youssouf Mulumbu that saw referee Lee Probert produce a red card.

What is without question is that Ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives. Five successive defeats preceded this game, but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes.

The hosts responded, with a cross by Chris Baird sent trickling wide by Ideye four yards out. Soon after Vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him. Baird continued play to the fury of Sandro, who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the Albion defender. Vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later, bringing the introduction of Niko Kranjcar. The Croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute, flicking on a corner by Matt Phillips to find Austin unmarked at the far post. The QPR striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his Premier League tally to 16, his fourth against West Brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at Loftus Road. Two minutes before the interval, Zamora provided that moment to take the breath. Phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area.

Inexperienced referee Davide Massa brandished a red card in the direction of Morata after a clumsy challenge, which warranted nothing more than a yellow,\u00a0on Alessandro Diamanti with just two minutes left to play. Marchisio will definitely miss the final against either Napoli and Lazio due to an accumulation of bookings, while Morata should be confident of winning an appeal.

A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen\u2019s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn\u2019t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn\u2019t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night . \u2018It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,\u2019 he said. \u2018They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we\u2019ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. \u2018If you want to develop players and get passing football, it\u2019s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It\u2019s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. \u2018It\u2019s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it\u2019s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren . \u2018If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. \u2018They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don\u2019t train there and there aren\u2019t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That\u2019s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.\u2019 TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. \u2018I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different!

{"input": "Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game\u2019s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport\u2019s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. \u2018I\u2019m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,\u2019 said the South African legend. \u2018When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986 . Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009 . Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters . \u2018Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.\u2019 It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is \u2018bulking up\u2019 too much in the gym. \u2018I\u2019m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don\u2019t watch what they eat,\u2019 he says. \u2018Just because they\u2019re lazy, they can\u2019t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National . \u2018I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn\u2019t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. \u2018I\u2019m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . \u2018Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That\u2019s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can\u2019t be bothered to talk to the fans and it\u2019s so wrong.\u2019 Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. \u2018I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,\u2019 he said. \u2018I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I\u2019d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. \u2018I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011 . Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament . \u2018It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?\u2019 Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. \u2018There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,\u2019 said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf\u2019s Mount Rushmore.", "answer": "Gary Player considers Tiger Woods Grand Slam at 24 as best golfing feat .\nSouth African will attend his 58th Masters this week at Augusta National .\nPlayer is excited at the prospect of Rory McIlroy joining exclusive club .\nMcIlroy could become only the sixth player to win all four majors .", "completion": ["Golf legend Gary Player predicts that Rory McIlroy will win the Masters and become the sixth player to win all four majors at the age of 25, a feat Player considers one of the sport's finest accomplishments."]}

{"input": "A week in the Bahamas, lapping up the sun and the odd glass of champagne, gazing across the yachts bobbing in the marina. It sounds idyllic, but perhaps is not the way you might imagine Ian Poulter prepares to win the Masters. But Poulter promises this break, just weeks before the first major of the year, means he will be fit and fresh for his latest assault on Augusta National. The downtime ensured plenty of opportunity to dream about feeling that green jacket draped over his shoulders, and what meal he would choose for the champion\u2019s dinner the following year. Not that he needs to think too hard about that last bit. \u2018I hate tempting fate,\u2019 he says while reclining on a lounger in his luxury holiday apartment in New Providence. \u2018But I know exactly what my jacket measurements are and I know exactly what [dinner] I would choose. But I\u2019m not telling you!\u2019 Ian Poulter  lines up his putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . These are certainly not the words of a man who feels he is taking things too easy in the build-up to the most eagerly-anticipated week of the golfing year. \u2018I\u2019ve tried every type of formula,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve had two weeks off before; I\u2019ve played [tournaments] during the run-in; I\u2019ve tried going to Augusta several days before Masters week to get some extra prep in. I\u2019ve tried everything but nothing\u2019s worked.\u2019 So this year Poulter, who has two top 10 finish at the Masters in his 10 attempts, has simply said to hell with it, let\u2019s have some fun. Family comes first, practice comes second. Sharing his holiday with the world on Twitter comes third, of course. Poulter celebrates  during the fourball match on the second day of the Ryder Cup golf tournament . By now, however, the serious work has begun. Some of his time in the Bahamas was spent on the range, before the workload was ramped up last week. The Ryder Cup defines Poulter, gets his juices flowing, his eyes and veins popping like nothing else. But he lives for the annual trip down Magnolia Lane. \u2018The electricity, the tension, the buzz\u2019 of Masters week give him goosebumps. He admits to a \u2018love affair\u2019 with the place and its storied history. Only the Open Championship can compete with the Masters for his affections and ambitions. But at the age of 39, and with Rory McIlroy leading a new breed of power hitters ready to clean up the majors, Poulter knows he will not get too many more chances of claiming either prize. Poulter plays into the 13th green during the final round of the 2014 Turkish Airlines Open . So, if push came to shove, would he take a green jacket over a claret jug? \u2018That\u2019s a very unfair question,\u2019 he says. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t take it. Because I think I\u2019ll win a claret jug, and I think I\u2019ll win a green jacket. And I\u2019m quite happy to put my neck on the line.\u2019 In a flash, there is the mentality that has vanquished many an American dream. Despite Poulter\u2019s Ryder Cup heroics, he has still never won a strokeplay event on US soil. He came close to victory in the Honda Classic last month but a final-round collapse featuring five balls in the water extended that duck. Yet the lion-hearted Englishman believes he will still claim the game\u2019s two biggest prizes. Poulter admits the prospect of retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled. But he has already written his rags-to-riches story, from assistant club professional in Hertfordshire to super-rich superstar in Florida. He knows he will be able to reflect one day on an extraordinary career. English golfer Poulter admits retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled . \u2018Yeah I\u2019d feel incomplete [without a major] but I\u2019d feel very content living the rest of my life knowing that I gave it a good go. It wouldn\u2019t stop me sleeping at night, I can certainly say that much. I want to win, I\u2019m passionate about winning, that\u2019s what keeps me going. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m working very hard and if guys beat me fair and square then that\u2019s fine.\u2019 Two top-10 finishes at Augusta in the last five years suggests there will not be too many who can be confident of beating Poulter next week. He admits, however, that the \u2018truly remarkable\u2019 McIlroy could be one of them. Going for the career grand slam at the age of 25 is simply \u2018incredible\u2019, but even if this is not the week that feat is achieved, Poulter insists the Northern Irishman is already the equal of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Poulter smiles during practice ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup on the PGA Centenary course at  Gleneagles . \u2018We knew years ago when he burst on to the scene this kid was going to be good,\u2019 he says. \u2018We didn\u2019t know how good. It happens every decade or couple of decades that someone comes along, gets inspired, works incredibly hard, is very dedicated, and proves that anything is possible. \u2018Rory is one of those kids who has the natural talent, work ethic and is impressive to watch. When he\u2019s on form he\u2019s as good as anybody has ever been.\u2019 But for all the effusive praise, Poulter rates Bubba Watson as the man to beat this year, not McIlroy. Rory McIlroy  hits his tee shot on the third hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . The defending champion will be chasing his third Masters win in four years and Poulter reckons the huge-hitting left-hander\u2019s game is so well suited to Augusta, even the world No 1 might not be able to match him. Six left-handed winners in the last 12 years \u2014 Mike Weir, Phil Mickelson (three times) and Watson (twice) \u2014 is clearly playing on Poulter\u2019s mind. He would not be alone among the players in wondering how they can compete on what Poulter admits is a \u2018bomber\u2019s course\u2019. Still, is Bubba really the man to beat, rather than Rory? \u2018For sure. Absolutely. He hits it long, he hits a nice cut off every tee. When you hit it 340 yards with a slight cut, I\u2019d like to play that golf course. Yeah, I think he\u2019s the favourite.\u2019 So how can Poulter compete with Watson, McIlroy and the other monster hitters? \u2018That course lends itself to a cut, or if you\u2019re a right-hander a draw. We all know that before we get there. It\u2019s a case of practising certain shots. There are some key holes round there which a draw will favour, or a cut of you\u2019re a left-hander. We all know it, we just have to work on it. \u2018I have to stick to my game plan. I can\u2019t hit it 340, I\u2019ll try to get it out there at 300 and provided my short game and wedge game is very, very good and my putting is good then I\u2019ll definitely have a chance come Sunday.\u2019 If that plan comes to fruition, there\u2019s a fair chance Poulter might spend more than just one week living it up in the Bahamas. He\u2019d richly deserve it, too. And he wouldn\u2019t even have to spend time worrying about what he\u2019d choose for the champions dinner in 2016.

{"input": "Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has fanned the flames of Raheem Sterling's contract stand-off with Liverpool by insisting he would sell any player who wanted to leave his club. Sterling's commitment to Liverpool is in doubt after he gave a televised interview on Wednesday explaining why he has chosen to put talks over a new deal on hold. As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, Chelsea are interested in the 20-year-old and have been asked to be kept updated on his future. Arsenal are also keen on the England international. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new \u00a3100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool . Jose Mourinho insists that he would sell any of his Chelsea players if they did not want to play for the club . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is adamant that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will play Sterling at Arsenal in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite the player admitting that he is 'flattered' by interest from the north London club. Rodgers insists Sterling is not for sale this summer at any price, despite his reluctance to sign an extension. But Mourinho said: 'I don't like players that don't want to play for me and my club. My opinion is every player has a price. 'It doesn't matter which player. If you ask me, for example, do I want Eden Hazard to leave Chelsea? No. If he wants to leave and doesn't want to work with me, doesn't want to play for Chelsea, does he have a price? I think he has. But I also understand the philosophy of managers and clubs who want to keep the players at any price. My philosophy is not better than that, it's just mine.'

Sterling will start against Arsenal  despite admitting it was 'quite flattering' to be linked with the Gunners .

Rodgers has resisted the temptation to leave out Sterling on Saturday after a turbulent three days following his revelation of the reasons for stalling over a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract. Sterling's remarks about being flattered by Arsenal's interest have only added to suspicions that his representatives are trying to engineer a move to London. But Rodgers believes that Sterling will react 'very strongly' to the situation and has the right temperament to handle a game that Liverpool need to win to close a six-point gap on Arsenal in the race for a top-four finish. 'He will play,' said the Liverpool boss. 'If it was a different player I would maybe have something to think about. But with this kid, since he has come in, trained and worked with me, he has been phenomenal and I expect him to go there and perform at a high level. 'I think he is a strong character.

Toure told the Liverpool Echo: 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he would not be sure to start games.

But he says the 20-year-old is not good enough to make the same move to the Spanish capital. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City are all said to be interested in the hottest property in English football, but Liverpool are determined not to let one of their star players leave, even with his contract expiring at the end of next season.

Owen feels that Sterling is in a great place to develop, but argues that it doesn't mean the youngster owes the club anything. 'There is no question he (Sterling) has been at the perfect place to learn his trade and he has been managed fantastically well so far,' Owen said. 'But that shouldn't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club. If the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it. 'A club is quick to get rid of a player when they don't serve a purpose anymore so why should a player not do what's best for him when the boot is on the other foot?' Owen scored 158 goals during his time at Liverpool, spending eight seasons on Merseyside until 2004 . Owen bursts away from Bruno Ngotty of Bolton Wanderers before he left Liverpool for Real Madrid . Owen left Liverpool for Real Madrid in a \u00a316.8million move in 2004 before later moving on to Newcastle United . Sterling is expected to start for Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off against Arsenal after Brendan Rodgers stated his intention to keep hold of the winger. And Owen says that the lack of a place in Real or Barcelona's teams mean that the only move he could make away from Anfield would be a sideways one. Sterling spoke in an interview with the BBC this week about his career ambitions and turning down the deal . The presence of Cristiano Ronaldo and co leave Owen unconvinced that a move to Spain would be right . 'Having watched him closely throughout his professional career, it it is fair to say that his progress has been spectacular,' he wrote on sportlobster. But he is still a notch or two off being \"world class\". 'I don't see what realistic options he has got if a move away from Anfield was on his mind.

{"input": "Jaap Stam had just ordered a new kitchen for his Cheshire home when he was informed by Sir Alex Ferguson that he was being sold to Lazio. The then Manchester United manager didn\u2019t mention in the same conversation that his son, Jason, stood to make a seven-figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal. No, Stam\u2019s representatives would discover that later. Raheem Sterling shakes hands with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . The two were at Melwood alongside the rest of the Liverpool squad in preparation for clash with Arsenal . Rodgers remains confident that Sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer . Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself, according to Roy Keane . But even so, it prompted Roy Keane to explain to me \u2013 for a column I was ghosting at the time - why a footballer should \u2018always look after No 1\u2019. United\u2019s captain scoffed at the idea that loyalty really existed in football. \u2018Jaap has discovered that, to football clubs, players are just expensive pieces of meat,\u2019 said Keane, without a hint of concern as to how his views might impact on his own relationship with his employers. Keane would probably feel Raheem Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself. Sterling might be 20 and he might want what seems a ludicrous amount of money for a player, while hugely promising, remains relatively unproven. But he already has a young family to support and he has ambitions not just to win trophies but to make as much money as he possibly can. In truth, the only issue right now is how he is choosing to go about getting what he wants. He has an agent, in Aidy Ward, who is developing something of a reputation for an aggressive strategy for his clients \u2013 we saw as much when he turned up at Old Trafford last month with Saido Berahino \u2013 and the approach he is employing here is not exactly endearing Sterling to anyone. Sterling's agent Aidy Ward next to Saido Berahino (centre) at Old Trafford for Man United against Arsenal . Jaap Stam was a fixture of Manchester United's central defence from 1998-2001 before being sold to Lazio . Former Manchester United midfielder Keane insists that a footballer should 'always look after No 1' My guess is Liverpool wouldn\u2019t have been as upset by his appearance on the BBC as some might think. Sterling and Ward should probably realise that, right now, \u00a3100,000 a week is a generous offer. Just as they should realise that switching to a club like Manchester City might not be the smartest move at this stage of his development. Better to remain at Anfield where he will play regularly under Brendan Rodgers; a manager who hasn\u2019t exactly done a bad job of developing Sterling so far. On Friday, Rodgers said he remained confident that Sterling would stay; that the situation would resolve itself in the summer. But I wonder if it will when Ward and Sterling are employing such aggressive tactics and Liverpool have made clear their own approach to future contract negotiations with their players. For the top players Liverpool pay handsomely. Daniel Sturridge is believed to be earning around \u00a3150,000 a week and Steven Gerrard always felt well-enough rewarded for a player Ferguson once regarded as the \u2018most influential\u2019 in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (right) is believed to be earning around \u00a3150,000 a week . Steven Gerrard trains at Melwood as he keeps fit during his period of suspension for Liverpool . But Liverpool do not have the financial muscle of a City or a Chelsea and that could yet result in them losing Sterling. Only recently Ian Ayre, the Liverpool chief executive, explained the club\u2019s strategy and a move towards more performance-related contracts. \u2018In any business you can make lots of money but if you let it go out of the door in other ways, then you are in trouble,\u2019 he said. \u2018The obvious biggest outgoing is players\u2019 wages and transfer fees. That\u2019s taken a pretty dramatic change in terms of how we look at it, analyse it and pay for it - and how we structure contracts. \u2018We pay good pay for our players; we pay fair pay. But we also like to give them the appetite to earn more which we know footballers like to do. As we all do. \u2018That\u2019s a far cry from deals where it is sort of nailed on and then it doesn\u2019t matter whether they perform or do not perform. \u2018So we are just trying to find a balance. I think other teams are doing that as well - or at least trying to do that. \u2018And it\u2019s certainly working for us - we have a happy bunch of players.\u2019 Sterling scored his first goal for England during their 4-0 win over Lithuania last Friday . The 20-year-old Liverpool forward uploaded this picture to Instagram from inside his home . Clearly, not everyone is happy. But that is not necessarily Liverpool\u2019s fault. They have a business to run and they have a duty to run it well. At the same time, Sterling will rightly feel he has a duty to his family to make as much money as he can during his relatively short career as a professional footballer. But he is not thinking it through carefully enough and nor, you suspect, is his agent. A footballer\u2019s image can have a huge financial value in modern football and right now Sterling\u2019s is taking a battering. And if he does move to another club and he fails to progress at the rate he currently is at Liverpool, he could find that has an impact on future earnings.

Saracens are the nation's solitary representative in the semi-finals after Bath, Northampton and Wasps tumbled out of the Champions Cup over the weekend, scraping through 12-11 against Racing Metro. Most alarming of the defeats was Clermont's spellbinding 37-5 rout of reigning Premiership champions and runaway leaders Saints, whose director of rugby Jim Mallinder admitted the result points to a chasm between the English and French leagues.

Fresh from Ferrari's first victory in 35 grands prix in Malaysia 11 days ago, and ending his own 20-race drought, Vettel returned to a hero's welcome at the team's factory at Maranello last week. The win allowed Ferrari to revive a tradition not seen at their base for almost two years since their previous triumph in May 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix courtesy of Fernando Alonso. Sebastian Vettel reflected on his stunning win for Ferrari at the Malaysian Grand Prix during the press conference before the weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . The four-time world champion shares a friendly discussion with McLaren star Jenson Button . Four-times world champion Vettel said: 'It was a great victory we had in Malaysia, great for us as a team, and for myself a very emotional day - my first win with Ferrari. 'When I returned to the factory on Wednesday, to see all the people there was quite special. There are a lot of people working there and as you can imagine they were very, very happy. 'The team hadn't won for quite a while, so they enjoyed the fact they had something to celebrate. There were a couple of rituals involved, so it was nice for them to get that feeling again.' Asked as to the specific nature of the rituals, Vettel replied: 'I was supposed to be there for simulator work anyway, but it was quite nice to receive the welcome after the win. Ferrari's Vettel and Britta Roeske  arrive at the Shanghai circuit . Along with a Ferrari mechanic, Vettel caught up with members of his old team Red Bull on Thursday . 'All the factory got together for a quick lunch. It was quite nice to have all the people together in one room - it was a big room! - so we were able to celebrate altogether for a bit. 'I also learned when you win with Ferrari, at the entry gate, they raise a Ferrari flag - and obviously it's been a long time since they last did that. 'Some 10 years ago there were a lot of flags, especially at the end of a season, so this flag will stay there for the rest of the year. 'We will, of course, try and put up another one sometime soon.' Inside the Ferrari garage, Vettel shares a discussion with team staff as he looks to build on his Sepang win . Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene shares a conversation with Vettel at the team's hospitality suite . The feeling is that will not happen after this weekend's race in China as the conditions at the Shanghai International Circuit are expected to suit rivals Mercedes. Not that Vettel believes his success will be a one-off, adding: 'For here and the next races, we should be able to confirm we have a strong package and a strong car. 'We will want to make sure we stay ahead of the people we were ahead of in the first couple of races, but obviously knowing Mercedes are in a very, very strong position. 'In general, for the start of a season things can be up and down, and we want to make sure there is quite a lot of ups, not so many downs. 'But it's normal in some races you are more competitive than others. 'We managed to do a very good job in Malaysia, but for here and the next races we have to be realistic about we want to achieve.'

Both sides started strongly, but it was the Sounders' Lamar Neagle had the first chance of the game after nine minutes, flicking on from a cross that was tipped over the crossbar by Jaime Pendeo. Neagle again saw a header blocked by the keeper after 21 minutes and though it was the visitors with the best of the early chances, one minute later the Galaxy were ahead. Juninho sent a cross dep into the penalty area and centre back Omar Gonzalez rose to direct it back across Stefan Frei's goal. The Swiss goalkeeper scrambled to re-adjust but was beaten to it by Gordon who could hardly miss and duly put the Galaxy into the lead. Neagle had a third chance on the stroke of half-time but couldn't find the net having exploded through the Galaxy defence only to place his shot too close to Penedo who saved easily, diving to his right. The home side went in at the break ahead, and they came close to doubling their lead almost immediately after the break when Robbie Rogers shot low, forcing Frei into a sharp save at his near post. Juninho fired wide from distance moments later. Brad Evans  of Seattle Sounders wins a high ball against Galaxy goalscorer  Gordon in the first half . But back came the Sounders, and they should have levelled when Andy Rose latched on to a low cross but fired straight at Penedo from point-blank range when anywhere else would have led to a goal. The remainder of the game saw few clear-cut chances. Obafemi Martins had an effort easily saved from distance and while the home side looked dangerous on the break they often failed with the final ball.

{"input": "Steven Finn believes pace does not matter in his quest to break back into England's Test squad. The Middlesex seamer admitted he finds it 'baffling' he faces criticism for not hitting the highly-prized 90mph mark, vowing to chase an England recall despite missing the West Indies tour. The 26-year-old was one of the few pluses of a dismal World Cup run, and is now intent on forcing his way into the reckoning for next summer's Test challenges against New Zealand and Australia. Finn, pictured at the Middlesex photo call ahead of the county season, has vowed to regain his England place . Finn hit back at those critics who say he should be hitting the 90mph mark with his bowling . 'The frustrating thing is that I've never been somebody who bowls 90 miles an hour for a whole day of cricket, that's simply never happened in my career,' said Finn. 'So it's frustrating when people say 'you've lost pace, you've lost this, you've lost that' when I haven't. 'Maybe I bowled the odd spell up above 90 that I'm working back towards, but consistently my paces have been the same as they have in the past. 'But because there are other bowlers in the world who are bowling 95 miles an hour consistently, it's like we're searching for that, and it's almost falling on my head. 'It's as though people are saying 'you're the guy who's done it for a few spells, so why aren't you doing it all the time?'. 'So it's frustrating that people keep talking about that, because if you're taking wickets, why does it matter if you're bowling 87 or 93 miles an hour. Finn celebrates a wicket during England's World Cup win over Scotland back in February . Finn, seen after taking five wickets in England's World Cup warm-up over India, was a high point of the tour . 'What does it matter? You're taking wickets. 'So that to me is baffling and it's silly to me, I find it stupid, but each to their own. 'Yes there might be a couple of extra miles an hour in there, as I've always been searching for. 'Ever since I was 20 and came into international cricket I've always been looking at how I am going to get better and make myself a member of the England team who is hard to be left out. 'And that's what I'm working back towards, and I certainly feel I'm on the way.' Watford-born Finn was sent home midway through England's disastrous Ashes tour that ended in 5-0 defeat early last year. The pace bowler wrestled with his action for months, but has since hit back to form, and is now confident he can reach new heights and resurrect his Test career. Coach Peter Moores overlooked Finn for the current three-Test West Indies tour, but has told the Middlesex star he remains in England's plans. Finn fixes the hair of team-mate Tim Murtagh as Middlesex posed for their traditional pre-season photograph . Finn shares a joke with Neil Dexter as the team convened at Lord's ahead of the new county campaign . 'I've been told I'm doing nothing wrong, but obviously to be left out of a tour obviously I am doing something wrong,' said Finn. 'So again, all I can do, and this is what they said to me, is to go and take wickets, enjoy playing for Middlesex, and 'you're very much in our thoughts'. 'It's reassuring for me to know that I've not been totally discarded as England cricketer because that would frustrate me and anger me deeply because I still feel I've got something to give to English cricket. 'I'm moving in the right direction, I feel like I'm there and that I can compete in international cricket, because I did this winter. 'And it's just about finding that extra little bit that's going to turn me from being a fringe player into someone who's in the team. 'That's where I was a couple of years ago, I'm not saying I'm looking to the past: I don't want to be the bowler I used to be, I want to be the bowler that I can be.

The England captain scored a spectacular overhead kick to win the derby and keep their title hopes alive . 2) Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009, Michael Owen 96 minute winner . In a ding-dong game at Old Trafford, Craig Bellamy scored a late equaliser for the visitors, as the home fans fell silent but with virtually the last kick of the game, Ryan Giggs found Michael Owen, who slotted home past the on-rushing Shay Given. Rooney says it's a game he'll never forget: 'It was end to end for a lot of the game and when Craig Bellamy equalised in the 90th minute everyone thought that was it, so when Michael Owen scored in the last few seconds it was an unbelievable moment for both Michael and the team and it's certainly a moment I will never forget.' Michael Owen (right) scored a 96 minute winner not long after Craig Bellamy had equalised for the visitors . 3) Manchester United 3-1 Manchester City, January 2010, Rooney sends his side to Wembley . Former United striker Carlos Tevez looked like he'd sent the Carling Cup semi-final into extra-time after cancelling out goals from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick, but Rooney had other ideas, when he headed home a stoppage time goal and send his side to Wembley. Rooney said: 'To score the decisive goal late on in any game is a special feeling for any player, but to do it in a derby and to send your team into a final makes it even better.' Rooney scored a stoppage time winner to send United through to the Carling Cup final at Wembley . 4) Manchester City 0-1 Manchester United, April 2010, Scholes heads home last-gasp goal . The midfield maestro's rare header was the third stoppage time goal United had scored against their rivals in that season, as they kept their title hopes alive in a game they couldn't afford to slip-up, which is why Rooney ranks this goal as one of the most important. He said: 'Paul Scholes's header was vital for us that season and kept us in the title race. At that stage of the season every game is massive, especially when you need to win, so for something like that to happen just when you think the game is coming to an end is incredible.' Paul Scholes headed home an injury time to keep his side in the hunt for the Premier League title . 5) Manchester City 2-3 Manchester United, December 2012, Van Persie stoppage time free-kick . United's big signing of the season, Robin van Persie, proved his worth when he fired home a free-kick from the edge of the box for another stoppage time winner, putting Rooney and co six points clear at the top of the Premier League table. 'This was a massive game, they came to Old Trafford as the champions, said Rooney. 'So for Robin to score the winner late on and take us 6 points clear at the top of the table was very important'.

He clutches a glass of the homemade illegal brew in the clip, which also shows a stash of drink bottles, biscuits and crisps on a window ledge, before it was shared with friends on WhatsApp. Scroll down for video . Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who was jailed for stabbing a young father, has been filmed partying behind bars . He was caught on camera drinking illegal alcohol and dancing to explicit rap music with other inmates at\u00a0Coldingley prison in Surrey . Prison officers reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run-up to Christmas in December last year. Tesfamichael was jailed for life with a minimum of 13 years after he used a broken champagne bottle to stab Olu Olagbaju, 26, in Shadan's nightclub in the City of London in December 2006. The music producer collapsed and died after the attack, where witnesses described seeing the young father being held with his arms behind his back before he was stabbed in the chest. Eritrean-born\u00a0Tesfamichael, then 23 and living in Camden, north London, made his getaway in a Mercedes before fleeing to Italy and then Miami, U.S., before he was extradited back to Britain. The 50-second video clip was captured on a banned mobile phone and shared with friends on WhatsApp . Eritrean-born Tesfamichael will spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars for the stabbing of Olu Olagbaju, 26 . Mr Olagbaju was looking forward to the birth of his second child with fiancee Terri Jacob, who he already had a daughter with, when he was killed. The Ministry of Justice launched an internal investigation at the Category C prison, which houses 500 inmates, and dealt with those involved. A spokesperson from the Prison Service said: 'All identified prisoners have faced disciplinary action. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated.' Tesfamichael wears a grey vest as he dances around the prison with another inmate, who wears sunglasses . The footage also shows a stash of drinks bottles, crisps and biscuits being stored on a window ledge . The video has outraged members of the public after it was shared on social media. Vikki Heywood, wrote on Facebook: 'I think it's disgusting the stuff they can get up to in prison these days. I've seen other ones of take aways and stuff like that. 'They are there to be punished not rewarded. If they have it soo cosy they will never learn from there's mistakes [sic].' Richard Jones added: 'What's more shameless is that it's the authorities allowing the \"party\" to take place.' \u00a0Others described it as 'shocking' and 'disgraceful'.

Prison officers at Coldingley prison in Surrey\u00a0reportedly turned a blind eye to the partying, which happened in the run up to Christmas in December last year . Prison inmates use the yeast food spread to make illegal hooch dubbed 'Marmite Mule' behind bars . Prisoners are infamous for brewing illicit alcohol while they're behind bars with the DIY concoctions carrying a variety of names from 'pruno' to 'hooch'. But it is perhaps surprising to learn how inmates are able to make the beverages on such a limited amount of resources. In 2009 it was reported that Marmite had been banned from Dartmoor prison in Devon because inmates were using it to make super strength hooch. Dubbed 'Martmite Mule', prisoners added it to fruit, vegetables, bread and water, with the yeast in the food spread triggering the fermenting process of turning the sugars in the fruit into alcohol. The brew is then left over two weeks in old soft drink bottles or plastic bags before it is strained with a T-shirt or sock to remove the remains of the fruit and veg. It was also reportedly being used at privately-run Addiewell Prison in Scotland. Pruno, or prison wine, is renowned for being made by inmates because it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to them. It is usually made using a variation of\u00a0apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, candy, ketchup, sugar, milk, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Again, the use of a plastic bag, hot running water and a sock are needed during the fermentation process. The longer the concoction is left the stronger it will be with the alcohol volume ranging from 2 per cent to 14 per cent.", "answer": "Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, filmed dancing outside cell at Coldingley prison .\nHe was jailed for life after stabbing Olu Olagbaju with a champagne bottle .\nFootage shows stash of drink and snacks and was shared on WhatsApp .\nPrison officers said to turn blind eye to the partying in December, last year .", "completion": [" "]}
{"input": "Right from the moment he breezed through the doors at Old Trafford, Louis van Gaal was a man with a plan. The first season, he stated, would see him deliver Manchester United back into their rightful place in the Champions League. He would restore them to the Premier League top four but loftier aims of silverware would have to wait. His three-year vision would allow for such thoughts but, first things first, United needed to be dining from European football's top table again. Louis van Gaal is close to delivering his first-season aim of returning Man United into Champions League . Wayne Rooney smashes home during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday . United's win over Aston Villa took them third, eight points ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool in the table . April 12 Manchester City (H) April 18 Chelsea (A) April 26 Everton (A) May 2 West Bromwich Albion (H) May 9 Crystal Palace (A) May 17 Arsenal (H) May 24 Hull City (A) One season out of the Champions League was far from ideal, but two seasons would be an absolute disaster and something, he understood, that would not be tolerated. In November, even that was looking optimistic. A 1-0 defeat to Manchester City meant that United had taken just 13 points from their opening 10 matches - it was their worst start to a league campaign since 1986, when Ron Atkinson only lasted until November. They had also been humiliated in the Capital One Cup by League One side MK Dons. Once again, with a more than a hint of desperation, Van Gaal reminded everyone after the derby defeat that this was a long-term project. 'It's not good enough,' he said. 'But on the other hand, we are in a process, as I have said from the beginning. The process shall take more than one year, it shall take three years.' Suddenly, it seemed like Van Gaal was shifting the goalposts. Instead of finishing top four in his first season, was he now suggesting that United might only be worthy of those positions by year three? That didn't sound good. It took some time for United to hit their stride under Van Gaal but things have finally come together . United were again at their best in Saturday's 3-1 home win over Aston Villa, which took them third . United celebrate their title triumph in 2013 - Van Gaal's aim is to return such success to Old Trafford . But Van Gaal has been true to his word. Barring a catastrophic late collapse in form, United will be gracing the Champions League again next season. With an eight-point cushion established over Liverpool in fifth, United's faithful can look forward to those electric European nights against next season. Their failure to qualify for the continent's premier club competition this year is a mere blip, rather than a symbol of sustained decline. With matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City still to come, there is even far-fetched talk of United winning the title. Now that really would be an acceleration of the Van Gaal masterplan. That won't happen but there's no reason why United can't finish second or third, avoiding the necessity of a potentially tricky Champions League qualifier in August. United are on course, the plan is on track and Van Gaal can be satisfied. There are growing signs too that Van Gaal's team are looking like the Manchester United of old. Ander Herrera scored twice in Manchester United's 3-1 win over Aston Villa at the weekend . Juan Mata, who scored twice in the 2-1 win over Liverpool, has been excellent under Van Gaal . Angel di Maria (right) has been mainly playing from the bench during United's recent good run of form . Radamel Falcao (right) has also had to be content with a place on the bench . The 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday was another indication that United are now a settled side. The fluent, possession-based football and the waves of attack that were hallmarks of the Alex Ferguson era are slowly beginning to return. Van Gaal, after trying what seems like a million combinations, has found the shape and system that best makes use of the resources at his disposal. It seems to exclude Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao - combined value \u00a3103.5m - but while the money men won't be happy, everyone else is. Now that United have manoeuvred themselves into a strong position in the top four, Van Gaal can regard his first season in English football as a job well done. But year two demands further improvement. United must mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title and reach the later stages of the Champions League. Those are the expectations.

{"input": "Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals. With hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League crown looking increasingly forlorn, City have again failed to build on a title success. They were hampered last summer, however, with their punishment for breaching the Financial Fair Play regulations of European governing body UEFA including a \u00a349million net spending cap. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer . Pellegrini has said Manchester City must sign a 'crack' player such as striker Sergio Aguero . Man City are currently fourth in the Premier League . A return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after Sheikh Mansour's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option, for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions, but Pellegrini has warned they cannot stay idle. Pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a 'crack' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker Sergio Aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it. The Chilean, whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, said: 'Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it. 'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.' Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash. But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned. Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title . He said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.' Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted. He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second.

{"input": "Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. \u2018I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,\u2019 said McIlroy. \u2018I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.\u2019 Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. \u2018I think it\u2019s important to be in the final group, it\u2019s where you want to be,\u2019 said the 34 year old Englishman. \u2018Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.\u2019 World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: \u2018Ok, let\u2019s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.\u2019 For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth\u2019s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: \u2019Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.\u2019 And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was\u00a0astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it\u2019s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however \u2013 and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he\u2019s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy\u2019s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: \u2018To hell with it, let\u2019s go for it.\u2019 Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three \u2013 Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.", "answer": "Jordan Spieth set a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under-par .\nThe American carding a 70 to take a four-shot lead into the final round .\nJustin Rose collected five birdies on his final six holes to go 12 under .\nRory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among those at six under after 68s .", "completion": ["21-year-old Jordan Spieth maintains his lead in the 79th Masters, despite a strong challenge from Justin Rose, Phil Mickelson, and other top golfers, setting a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters."]}

{"input": "It's that time of the season when Premier League footballers cast their vote for the PFA Players\u2019 Player of the Year. Last year\u2019s winner Luis Suarez now resides in Spain, so, too, does 2013 victor Gareth Bale. It means we\u2019re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come May. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the six leading contenders\u2026 . Name: Harry Kane . Club: Tottenham . Age: 21 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 29 . Striker Harry Kane has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for Tottenham so far this season . Kane (second right) has twice been named Player of the Month during his breakthrough campaign . Kane (left) broke into the England squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against Lithuania . Reasons he deserves it: Very few would have predicted Kane would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early April in what is essentially his breakthrough season. His has been the name on everyone\u2019s lips since the turn of the year and last month\u2019s England call-up was thoroughly deserved. In an age where diving, spitting, lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda, Kane\u2019s goal-laden arrival has been a joy to witness. Reasons he doesn\u2019t: Are there any? You could argue it took him until November to score two Premier League goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities. Previous (individual) Premier League honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: Eden Hazard . Club: Chelsea . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 44, Goals 17 . Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's outstanding performer, scoring 17 times in 44 games . Hazard (left) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate . Hazard (centre) is the odds-on favourite to be named PFA Players' Player of the Year . Reasons he deserves it: He\u2019s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they\u2019ll edge Chelsea towards the title. Hazard, under the instruction of Jose Mourinho, has married graft to his craft and has been his side\u2019s outstanding player this season. The fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it\u2019s no surprise he is the odds-on favourite for the prize. Reasons he doesn\u2019t: Like Kane, it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis. It did, however, take the Belgian a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign. Previous honours: PFA Young Player of the Year 2014, PFA Team of the Year 2013 & 2014 . Name: Diego Costa . Club: Chelsea . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 30, Goals 18 . Reasons he deserves it: His immediate impact was sensational, smashing seven goals in his first four outings. His presence as the spearhead of Chelsea\u2019s attack has turned them into title winners and he isn\u2019t afraid to put in a shift either. Diego Costa has spearheaded Chelsea's attack this season, with 18 goals in 30 appearances . Costa (right) fires in the winner for Chelsea in their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield . Costa's bid to become Player of the Year could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury . Reasons he doesn\u2019t: He\u2019s missed too many games because of injury, as well as suspension, and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons. It is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the Spaniard. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Sergio Aguero . Club: Manchester City . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 31, Goals 23 . Reasons he deserves it: Without his goals City\u2019s title challenge would have faded long ago. It has been a poor season at the Etihad. Aguero, though, has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance. His four goals against Spurs and match-winning treble versus Bayern Munich are among the best individual performances of the season. Meanwhile, he was so devastating during his two-goal show at Sunderland that the home crowd rose to applaud the Argentine when he made way late on. Sergio Aguero has again been in prolific scoring form for Manchester City, blasting 23 goals in  31 matches . Aguero (right) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015 . Reasons he doesn\u2019t: If Aguero managed to avoid what are all-too-frequent visits to the treatment room then City might be pushing Chelsea harder for the league title. He only has three league goals in 2015 and, while his numbers remain impressive, that lack of consistency will cost him votes. Previous honours: Player of the Month (2) Name: David de Gea . Club: Manchester United . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 37, Clean sheets 13 . David de Gea (left) has been outstanding for Manchester United with 13 clean sheets this season . De Gea shone for United in the early part of the Premier League campaign when United struggled for form . De Gea's displays have been integral to United's top-four charge and he has been their best player . Reasons he deserves it: Only De Gea was spared criticism as United struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season. Indeed, there was an argument that, without his points-saving heroics, Louis van Gaal might have come under pressure far sooner. He has matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of Real Madrid. Reasons he doesn\u2019t: Only the goalkeeper in a title-winning side would land the PFA prize, you feel. For while De Gea has been United\u2019s best player, he has not single-handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the Premier League crown. Previous honours: PFA Team of the Year 2013 . Name: Alexis Sanchez . Club: Arsenal . Age: 26 . Stats: Apps 43, Goals 20 . Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running at Arsenal following his Barcelona switch, with 20 goals in 43 games . Sanchez hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season . Chile international Sanchez has added greater aggression to Arsenal's attacking line with his arrival . Reasons he deserves it: There was a suspicion it would take the Chilean time to settle in the Premier League. Well, he didn\u2019t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18. His energy, aggression and will to win \u2013 coupled with bags of quality \u2013 has made all to the difference to an Arsenal side previously lacking in such vigour. Reasons he doesn\u2019t: His goals have dried up since January and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast. However, he is still a certainty for Arsenal\u2019s individual annual honours. Previous honours: Player of the Month (1) Name: Jordan Henderson . Club: Liverpool . Age: 24 . Stats: Apps 45, Goals 7 . Reasons he deserves it: He has emerged as Liverpool\u2019s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park. Henderson barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country \u2013 not bad for a player who Sir Alex Ferguson said could not run properly. He\u2019s also added goals to his game and is a real pro\u2019s pro \u2013 it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes. Jordan Henderson (centre) has continued his development into an essential player for Liverpool this season . Henderson emerged as Liverpool's future captain with Steven Gerrard (right) leaving at the end of the season . Henderson has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout Liverpool's campaign . Reasons he doesn\u2019t: It hasn\u2019t been a vintage year for Liverpool and their bid for Champions League football looks set to end in failure. As good as Henderson has been, this will almost certainly cost him the top prize. Previous honours: None . VERDICT: If the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season\u2019s Young Player of the Year, Eden Hazard. However, don\u2019t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards Harry Kane within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes. And that Roy of the Rovers tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game. Kane certainly gets my vote!", "answer": "Premier League footballers are voting for PFA Players' Player of the Year .\nEden Hazard and Harry Kane are the leading candidates for the award .\nSergio Aguero, Alexis Sanchez and David de Gea are also contenders .\nLuis Suarez won last year with Gareth Bale taking the prize the year before .", "completion": ["The Premier League footballers are casting their votes for the PFA Players\u2019 Player of the Year, with Harry Kane, Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, Sergio Aguero, David de Gea, Alexis Sanchez, and Jordan Henderson as the leading contenders."]}
{"input": "Louis van Gaal couldn\u2019t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney\u2019s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United . Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira .

Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish . Booked:\u00a0Delph . Scorer: Benteke 80 . Man of the match: Ander Herrera . Referee: Roger East 6 . Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? \u2018It plays a part in the spirit of the players \u2014 of our opponents but also our players,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. \u2018I don\u2019t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven\u2019t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.\u2019 Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United\u2019s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal\u2019s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011 . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November . Rooney likes playing against Villa \u2014 this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point . \u2018It was another Manchester United, I believe,\u2019 said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. \u2018We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. \u2018So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it\u2019s not the same Manchester United. It\u2019s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea \u2014 you have to win these kinds of matches.\u2019 With Liverpool\u2019s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United\u2019s run-in is laced with demanding assignments \u2014 aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 \u2014 but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium . Man United vs Man City - April 12 . Chelsea vs Man United - April 18 . Everton vs Man United - April 26 . Man United vs West Brom - May 2 . Crystal Palace vs Man United - May 9 . Man United vs Arsenal - May 17 . Hull vs Man United - May 24 .

Man City vs QPR - May 10 . Swansea vs Man City - May 17 . Man City vs Southampton - May 24 . Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as \u2018crippling\u2019, simply couldn\u2019t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. \u2018We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it\u2019s going to be a great game,\u2019 said Ashley Young, who admitted he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 to not be selected for the last round of England games. \u2018Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.\u2019 There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney\u2019s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. \u2018It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,\u2019 Young added. \u2018United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be \u2013 and even how we finish the game.

{"input": "With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March . Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League . Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit . Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play . And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.' Deeney is adamant that together he and Ighalo could terrorise Premier League defences. 'I've been and watched a few games this season and I don't see why not,' he said. Watford striker\u00a0Odion Ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign . Deeney has been impressed with\u00a0Slavisa Jokanovic since the\u00a0Watford manager took charge in October . 'I think you have to be very ruthless in the Premier League and we've shown that we can score goals. 'Are we confident we can do it? Definitely.' Watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion-chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss Slavisa Jokanovic took charge in October. But referring to that period Deeney, who has played under seven managers since joining Watford from Walsall in 2010, insists: 'It wasn't that bad.' He added: 'It definitely brought the players closer together. 'It's just one of those things really, in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesn't change.' Watford have won 15 of Jokanovic's 27 matches in charge and Deeney has been impressed by the Serbian's tactical flexibility. Ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall, he said: 'We've got a talented squad so we can go from 4-4-2 to 4-4-2 diamond to 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. 'His (Jokanovic's) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out.' Former Watford boss\u00a0Beppe Sannino handed Deeney the captain's armband during his brief spell in charge . But Deeney's role in the revival of Watford's season, not just as goalscorer but as captain, cannot be underestimated. Beppe Sannino made him captain before the start of the season and Deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water. 'I was very vocal anyway,' he said. 'If I've got something to say I'm going to say it anyway, good or bad, and I think that once people know me they respect that. 'If you're doing good I'll tell you you're doing good, if you're doing wrong I'll tell you you're doing wrong. I don't expect anything else of others towards myself. 'The added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example, I think that's the only that's changed. 'But then I think I did it pretty well beforehand, I think that's why they made me captain. They know what I'm about and what I offer. 'But now it's a case of justifying why they have made that decision.' Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release. Deeney has warned his Watford team-mates they have 'three weeks of hard work' ahead of them . 'The two are definitely linked,' he admits. 'But it's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity I had, instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by. 'I've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it, so it (prison) was probably a blessing in disguise.' Captaining Watford in the Premier League next season, Deeney admits, would be the crowning glory after three years' hard work following his release. 'That would be the fairytale ending,' said the 26-year-old. 'But we've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that, so I'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true.' You get the feeling Deeney will be playing in the Premier League regardless of what happens in the next few weeks. But  Watford have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side.", "answer": "Watford striker Troy Deeney is yet to play in the Premier League .\nDeeney is regarded as one of the best strikers outside the top-flight .\nHe has scored 64 goals in 123 games during his last three seasons .\nThe Hornets are currently just one point behind leaders Bournemouth .", "completion": ["Watford captain Troy Deeney, who has scored 20 goals this season and was named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, is hopeful of leading his team to the Premier League next season."]}

{"input": "Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton .

Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner.

{"input": "Tracey Neville would say she has never lived in the shadow of her footballing brothers. She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just \u00a3742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville . Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year . England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends . It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to \u00a34million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire \u2014 and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football . Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister . Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year . 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning \u00a329.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers . Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training . Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21 . 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup . Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes . Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester . 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.'

Horrific scar: Gary Mabbutt has been left with a\u00a030inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged requiring emergency surgery to save the limb . He was treated at King's College Hospital in South East London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching.

The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think \"It's never going to happen to me\". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.'

{"input": "Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid couldn't be separated in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown on Tuesday. The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID . Jan Oblak 9 -\u00a0Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 -\u00a0Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 -\u00a0A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal . Guilherme Siqueira 6\u00a0-\u00a0No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next\u00a0season.\u00a0Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7\u00a0-\u00a0Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 -\u00a0Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 -\u00a0Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the\u00a0initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . Koke 6\u00a0-\u00a0Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7\u00a0-\u00a0You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7\u00a0-\u00a0The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes:\u00a0Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID . Iker Casillas 7-\u00a0Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball . Dani Carvajal 7 -\u00a0Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira\u2019s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. Raphael Varane 8\u00a0-\u00a0Real Madrid's best performer. We knew he was quick but how quick! His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon . Sergio Ramos 6 -\u00a0Left trailing in Griezmann\u2019s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 -\u00a0Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7\u00a0-\u00a0Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second . Toni Kroos 6\u00a0-\u00a0A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid\u2019s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 -\u00a0Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 -\u00a0Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak\u2019s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal . Karim Benzema 5\u00a0-\u00a0Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6\u00a0- Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world\u2019s most expensive forward line couldn\u2019t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as\u00a0responsible\u00a0as\u00a0Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes:\u00a0Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used:\u00a0Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team .", "answer": "Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid draw 0-0 at Vicente Calderon .\nJan Oblak was excellent in goal for Atletico to keep Real at bay .\nGareth Bale had a huge chance to score an away goal for Real .\nRaphael Varane was Real Madrid's best player in defence .\nKarim Benzema's struggles against Atletico Madrid continued .", "completion": ["Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final showdown."]}

{"input": "Hillary Clinton's 'Everyday Americans' video has been given an 18 rating by a Russian television network - because it features two men holding hands. Dozhd TV, an independent network, fears the video launching Clinton's White House bid may fall foul of Putin's 'gay propaganda' laws - which allows the imposition heavy fines for promoting homosexuality to people under the age of 18. Clinton's video not only features Democrat campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, holding hands, but talking about their up-coming wedding. Restricted: A Russian television network has given Hillary Clinton's video an 18 rating because it features a gay couple, who are planning a summer wedding, holding hands . Equality: Jared Milrad (pictured right) and his fianc\u00e9 Nate Johnson, were delighted to be included in the video, saying it showed off the changing attitudes of the U.S. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I\u2019m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' The inclusion of the segment has won widespread support, and highlights Clinton's own stand on equality. Milrad himself has said he \u00a0was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton roll out - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, a 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. But it is at odds with Russia's view on LGBT rights, which have become increasingly restrictive during Vladimir Putin's presidency. However, Dozhd, an opposition network, told ABC News it had acted before being instructed by the Russian government. If they had aired it without the warning, the company could have faced a fine of as much as \u00a313,200 under 2013's gay propaganda laws. Dozhd is not the only company to take preemptive action like this: in March, Ikea pulled its online magazine IKEA Family Live, which 'demonstrates various aspects of home life regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation'. The Swedish retailer decided to remove it as there was a risk 'some material in our magazine can be considered as propaganda'. Backwards: But while the U.S. may be becoming more inclusive, Russia has recently been putting in place more repressive laws as the government becomes increasingly anti LGBT rights . Fine: Opposition television network\u00a0Dozhd decided to give it the rating to avoid getting a \u00a313,200 fine . Differing views: Putin (left) and Clinton (right) are on other sides of the divide when it comes to LGBT rights - with the former First Lady being a staunch supporter of equality . But it is not just the U.S. and Russia as countries which are at odds with each other: Putin and Clinton hold very differing views personally as well. Speaking in 2014, Putin claimed there was a need to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the country's birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a law. The Russian leader - who claims he has gay friends - has gone as far as to link gay people to pedophiles in the past. Meanwhile, the same year Putin signed the gay propaganda law into being, Secretary of State Clinton had publicly come out in support of gay marriage. 'LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship- that includes marriage,' she said in the video.

'Like so many others, my personal views have been shaped over time by people I have known and loved, by my experience representing our nation on the world's stage, my devotion to law and human rights, and the guiding principles of my faith.' Clinton also has a lot of support within the LGBT community, with the nation's largest lesbian political action committee launching Lesbians4Hillary to support her bid for the White House.

{"input": "Most parents have the souvenir of a scan of their child in the womb at 12 weeks. The must-have for IVF mums and dads these days, however, is a video and pictures right from the moment of conception. The images are thanks to revolutionary technology that allows medics to record the microscopic miracle of life \u2013 from fertilisation to the division of cells, right through to the growth of an embryo. Hundreds of parents are now the proud owners of these EmbryoScope images, which are also helping scientists learn more about the IVF process. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the very first cell division of Pixie Morley, now aged nine months, taken using the revolutionary EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley (pictured with their daughter Pixie) are one of some 1,500 couples in Britain who have had babies using EmbryoScope technology . Sally and Stephen Morley are among them. The grainy grey and white picture on this page shows the first cell division in the creation of their IVF baby, Pixie. A tiny camera, placed inside an incubator, films the reproduction process. As well as allowing parents to watch back the moment the embryos form, the technology \u2013 developed in the US \u2013 also allows experts to select the best possible embryos based on how they form during the conception process. This narrows a mother\u2019s chance of miscarrying. The Morleys, from Walsall, had spent months trying to have children naturally before opting for IVF. Mrs Morley, 38, the head of a nursery, said: \u2018I knew time was against me being 36 when we started trying so when I failed to get pregnant each month I knew we should have fertility tests as soon as possible.\u2019 While the couple were undergoing IVF, the EmbryoScope technology was introduced at the Midland Fertility Clinic, allowing them to be the first in their area to capture their child\u2019s conception on camera. The technology allows medics and parents to watch the cell dividing. Pictured is the cell division of now nine-month-old Pixie . In October 2013, the embryo was transferred into Mrs Morley\u2019s womb and within two weeks she was told by doctors that the process had been successful. Now, nine months after Pixie\u2019s birth, she is still able to re-watch the moment her daughter was conceived. Experts have hailed the technology as one of the most important developments in IVF. Professor Simon Fishel, who is boss of Care Fertility, the first clinic in Britain to use the EmbryoScope, said: \u2018We now know that embryos that do make babies and embryos that don\u2019t make babies do different things. 'And to be able to see this in a time-matched movie and to be able to analyse it scientifically is absolutely wonderful science for us.\u2019 Professor Fishel, who was part of the team that produced first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978, said the EmbryoScope was revealing the secrets about what happens to embryos as they develop \u2013 and why it is that around 70 per cent of them do not actually make babies. The videos were also an emotional milestone in the process of becoming a parent, Professor Fishel said. \u2018The couple can see the process of fertilisation, see the cells divide, see the number of cells grow and see them produce an embryo\u2026it is nothing short of observing the wonderful miracle of life.\u2019 The video given to parents is a sped-up version of the process which occurs before the embryo develops. Professor Fishel said his patients were \u2018awestruck\u2019 when given the footage but that the clinic only gave parents the video once a mother had fallen pregnant. He added that, at across the Care Fertility clinics, 1,000 couples, who had gone on to have a baby, had been given footage of their embryo\u2019s development.", "answer": "New technology allows parents of IVF children to view babies' conception .\nIt allows parents to see the embryo forming far before usual 12 week scan .\nMedics are able to watch process and select best embryo to be planted .\nSally and Stephen Morley among 1,500 couples in UK to use technology .", "completion": ["Revolutionary technology, EmbryoScope, allows IVF parents to own videos and pictures from the moment of conception, helping scientists learn more about the IVF process and allowing experts to select the best possible embryos, thereby reducing the chance of miscarriage."]}

{"input": "SPFL clubs are poised to do battle over a late Hibernian move to cash in on the Premiership play-offs. Currently second in the Championship, the Easter Road club stand to make \u00a31million from anticipated sell-out home gates against Rangers and the 11th place club in the Premiership - currently Motherwell. Under recently passed SPFL rules, however, play-off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play-off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days. And, faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches, Hibs chairman Rod Petrie has garnered support from Hearts and Motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play-off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The issue will go to the vote at the SPFL AGM next Thursday, but faces opposition from the SPFL board who believe the move puts self-interest above those of all 42 clubs. Hibernian face a battle over potentially lucrative gate revenues with lower league clubs . On Tuesday, one senior club figure told Sportsmail on condition of anonymity, that the Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell proposal was \u2018outrageous\u2019. \u2018The agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money,\u2019 Sportsmail was told. \u2018As part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play-offs. No one at that time anticipated you might have a Rangers-Hibs play-off final. \u2018Now there is a move by people with vested interests to say \u201cwe might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money!\u201d. And they are attempting to revisit it. \u2018That\u2019s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you can\u2019t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play-offs you are not happy with it.\u2019 Hibernian declined to comment last night although the Easter Road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six-figure broadcast deal for the play-offs and the imposition by the SPFL of new minimum pricing policy of \u00a315 and \u00a310 for all six matches. Hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play-off gate revenues to lower league clubs under SPFL rules . Hibernian are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next Thursday from Motherwell \u2013 also likely to be involved in the play-offs \u2013 and city rivals Hearts. One Easter Road source told Sportsmail: \u2018A rule change has been introduced by the SPFL stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play-off games for free. \u2018They have also imposed a minimum price of \u00a315 and \u00a310 for the play-offs. \u2018In addition there was no television money in place for the play-offs last year while this year they have secured six-figure revenues to go round the clubs. \u2018Add in the fact the parachute payments to the Premiership clubs are fully funded by the SFA \u2013 not the SPFL \u2013 and people at Hibs take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary.

Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015 . The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault, with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve. Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems.

'We are experimenting with a few things, but I think for now we have to go back to what we know, get our basics right,' said Ricciardo. 'We have done quite a bit. In Malaysia we had brake issues, a lot of overheating, so we have reverted back on a few things, even from last year which we knew was more efficient. 'Just because it's from last year it doesn't mean it's not better, so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction. The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side.

Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler\u2019s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by\u00a0QOTS' Chris Higgins . New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch \u2013 banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts\u2019 Osman Sow at the weekend \u2013 which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn\u2019t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall\u2019s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal.

Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes . One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie\u2019s head \u2013 at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn\u2019t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half . Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park . QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net . Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side\u2019s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break . QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good . Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler\u2019s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn\u2019t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players . Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall\u2019s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.", "answer": "Rangers were beaten by Queen of the South in the Scottish Championship .\nDerek Lyle opened the scoring for the hosts following a first-half corner .\nLee Wallace own goal doubled the Doonhammers' lead after the break .\nGavin Reilly completed the upset that dents Gers' hopes of second place .", "completion": ["Stuart McCall's Rangers suffered a 3-0 defeat to Queen of the South, marking McCall's first loss since taking charge of the club and leaving Rangers third behind Hibs on goal difference, with a game still in hand."]}
{"input": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes recent defeats are down to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system. The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us. Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff . 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa. Jordan Rhodes (centre) can cause Liverpool's leaky defence a number of problems in the FA Cup replay . They showed enough on Merseyside a month ago to suggest they can trouble the Reds and, having dispatched top-flight sides Swansea and Stoke at Ewood Park, they will have no fear of Liverpool's arrival. 'Blackburn have got some excellent players. They defended well when they came to Anfield,' said Rodgers. 'We'll go there really focused and determined - we can't wait to play again after the weekend's disappointment.'", "answer": "Brendan Rodgers admitted the recent defeats were down to his players .\nThe Liverpool boss denied that opposition managers have sussed him out .\nLiverpool appear to have slipped out of Champions League contention .\nREAD: Liverpool could sign Pedro if Sterling leaves Anfield this summer .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .", "completion": ["Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers attributes recent defeats to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system, insisting a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents."]}

{"input": "England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the \u2018contest,\u2019 England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side\u2019s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England\u2019s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner\u2019s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid\u2019s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England\u2019s unimaginative one-day thinking. England\u2019s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.", "answer": "England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320 .\nHosts hold out for a draw, but the game had descended into a farce .\nEngland will learn little from glorified net against woeful opposition .\nJames Tredwell out-bowls Adil Rashid in contest to be Test spinner .", "completion": ["England dominated a farcical match against a shambolic St Kitts Invitational XI, scoring 379 for six and bowling St Kitts out for 59 on the first day, and 76 for seven on the second day, with the match ending in a draw."]}

{"input": "Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if \u00a330million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal \u00a330m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over \u00a330m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .", "answer": "Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere .\nJordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions .\nWilshere, 23, encapsulates Arsene Wenger's style of play in north London .\nBut the England international is not\u00a0necessarily\u00a0a first-team regular .\nAny bids in excess of \u00a330m should be considered by Arsenal .", "completion": ["Manchester City is considering a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, and Arsenal may consider the offer if it exceeds \u00a330 million."]}
{"input": "'Kondogbia was incredible for Monaco, he was exactly the player Arsenal needed to sign,' Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp said back in February. The French midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium as the Ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg win. But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years . 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco . The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013 . Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2\", Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg . So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, with\u00a0Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team.

Van Gaal made no secret of his annoyance at United's pre-season schedule last summer. United had already committed themselves to a three-week long tour that took in five matches across five American cities by the time Van Gaal took over as manager. United travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip, which included games in Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Washington DC and Miami - all against high-profile opposition. This summer's tour is expected to see United take on fewer opponents and undertake less travel.

A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher\u00a0has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham\u2019s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327 million in today\u2019s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher\u2019s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford\u2019s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham\u2019s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He\u2019s no longer here to defend himself. It\u2019s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute\u2019s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy\u00a0brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.", "answer": "Mr Justice Popplewell says he has no reason to believe fire wasn't accident .\nThe former judge led the inquiry into the blaze at the Bradford City ground .\nComes after survivor of blaze says tragedy might not have been accident .\nAuthor Martin Fletcher says his findings warrant further investigation .", "completion": ["The former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire in 1985, which killed 56 football fans, has dismissed claims in a new book that the blaze was not an accident, calling them 'nonsense'."]}

Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion . City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One . And there\u2019s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill\u2019s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday . Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade . \u2018When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,\u2019 he tells Sportsmail. \u2018The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. \u2018We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.\u2019 That\u2019s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style . City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne . They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. \u2018Nobody wants that runners-up medal.

They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: \u2018I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.\u2019 The defender\u2019s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he\u2019s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: \u2018I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest!

The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March . \u2018I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. \u2018Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. \u2018But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort.

It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. \u2018The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that.

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports\u00a0Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back.

A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.

If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich\u2019s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.

There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for \u00a3140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of \u00a3842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich\u2019s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has\u00a0has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . \u2018He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,\u2019 said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. \u2018Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that\u2019s very, very good. I think it\u2019s important and I think it\u2019s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. \u2018The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn\u2019t accept the rules and didn\u2019t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . \u2018Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. \u2018Now we are going through a period where it\u2019s just about Gary Cahill.

Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England\u2019s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season\u2019s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: \u2018Don\u2019t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don\u2019t want to speak again about that game. \u2018Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. \u2018Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don\u2019t have to be watching Man City against Man United.

{"input": "Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James\u2019 Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver\u2019s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . \u2018This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,\u2019 said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult situation we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019ve not got a lot of players. \u2018But we can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. \u2018If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.\u2019 Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: \u2018The character is there in the team, even though we didn\u2019t show it last week (at Sunderland). \u2018We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. \u2018The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. \u2018We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. \u2018The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we\u2019d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . \u2018But we\u2019re not going to get any sympathy, we\u2019ve still lost the game.\u2019 Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season. The \u00a36million signing was only days away from returning after a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he suffered a collapsed lung in February. De Jong \u2013 who has made just one Premier League start \u2013 was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United\u2019s reserves when they entertain Derby County this evening.

{"input": "It may come as a surprise to some - particularly Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola - but Jose Mourinho has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson inspired him to try to be a gracious manager. The Chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph that the legendary Manchester United manager showed him 'two faces' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser. Mourinho had just made his first impression on the Champions League by knocking out United with unfancied Porto. The Portuguese sprinted down the touchline at Old Trafford in an unforgettable celebration of Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification and a seismic shock.

And after that I found the man with principles, with the respect for the opponent, with the fair play \u2013 I found these two faces in that period, and that was very important for me. 'In my culture, the Portuguese and the Latin culture, we don\u2019t have that culture of the second face; we are in football to win and when we don\u2019t there is not a second face most of the time. But when we beat United in the Champions League I got that beautiful face of a manager which I try to have myself. I try.' Mourinho has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game. His many spats with Wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the Arsenal boss, with Mourinho's accusation in 2005 that the Frenchman is like 'a voyeur' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all-time low, from which it has never recovered.

The 52-year-old, who looks set to claim his third Barclays Premier League title with Chelsea this season, also formed a spiteful relationship with Guardiola while the pair duelled for honours in Spain. Arguably Mourinho's lowest moment came in gouging the eye of Guardiola's assistant, Tito Vilanova, in the closing stages of a Spanish Super Cup defeat for Real Madrid against Barcelona.

Arsene Wenger revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return from a hamstring strain that has sidelined him since the FA Cup win over Manchester United on March 9. However, it is the recurrence of a long-standing groin problem that has caused the delay in Chamberlain's return to action, not the hamstring. Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s persistent groin problems . Oxlade-Chamberlain has been struggling with an ongoing groin problem for several months . The groin injury has been an ongoing problem for the England international for several months, but he, together with the club's medical staff, have managed it throughout the season. The root cause of the complaint remains unclear, with club doctors trying to establish a permanent cure for the problem. Arsenal are keen to surgery and are exploring other treatment methods to rid the former Southampton man of his groin discomfort. However, the option of an operation isn't being ruled out, though any procedure would only take place in the summer. Arsene Wenger has revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return to fitness . The 21-year-old should play again this season but the fear is that the problem could recur . Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss at least two more weeks, meaning he will not be available for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading. The 21-year-old should play again this season, but the fear is that the problem could recur. Surgery would mean another busy summer for Oxlade-Chamberlain as he'd be required to complete a rehabilitation programme before pre-season.

{"input": "Mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old Jordan Spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th Masters. For much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34-year-old Justin Rose and 45-year-old Ernie Els, as the Englishman and the South African posted scores of 67 to tie Charley Hoffman, an American representative of the rank and file. Last man out Jason Day would join them in the evening shadows. But by then Spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first-round leader in Masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th, where he brushed in a 25-foot birdie putt. Runner-up on his debut last year, he now owns a three-shot lead going into day two. Jordan Spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at Augusta to take a three-shot lead into the second round . Justin Rose made the early running with an impressive five-under-par 67 . Rose consoles Gunn Yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over . Most of the favoured names left Augusta National feeling reasonably content, as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Bubba Watson shot 71, while Dustin Johnson and Masters specialist Phil Mickelson opened with rounds of 70. Whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant Texan is another matter. Spieth has barely been off a leader-board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks, holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the Georgia pines into the middle of the fairway. It meant when he stood on the par-five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens. At that moment anything seemed possible \u2014 even a 62, thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155-year history of majors. Only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk-reward par five, as he ran up a six. Naturally, Spieth was not about to get greedy. \u2018I made a mistake but a 64, my first score in the sixties on this course, I have nothing to complain about,\u2019 he said. A packed crowd watch Rose on the 10th green during the first round . Rose and Charley Hoffman (above) made the early running at Augusta with a 67 . South African Ernie Els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on Thursday . Rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas. In nine previous starts Rose has led on three occasions after the first round. Here he equalled his best Masters score, recorded on the opening day in 2004. That year he went on to hold the 36-hole lead as well, while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round, eventually finishing tied fifth. Add all those memories of good days here to the fact he\u2019s now a proven major champion following his US Open triumph in 2013, and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit. Certainly that is how he is seeing it. \u2018I\u2019ve learned plenty from those previous occasions, like not getting ahead of yourself,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve learned that the hard way and now I can\u2019t see any reason why I shouldn\u2019t keep executing the gameplan. You\u2019ve got to believe in yourself, especially when you\u2019re a major winner.\u2019 Els used his ball-striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round . Rory McIlroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with Phil Mickelson, right, . McIlroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one-under-par . Rose wasn\u2019t the only Englishman to prosper, as in-form Paul Casey shot 69. \u2018I played with Paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove,\u2019 said Rose. After Greg Norman, Els might be the great hard-luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here. Given how good he was at 25, he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable McIlroy will win the Masters one day. Els is still trying, at 45, and what a joy to see one of the great ball-strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five-under score. A wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th. Only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment. Two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at Augusta. But he took three. McIlroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar Augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five.

At the sixth, his mis-hit chip came back down the steep slope but he didn\u2019t panic. He decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two. The value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next. On the back nine, it was more like it from the 25-year-old. Over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner Mickelson, but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th. \u2018I left myself in some awkward spots but I holed some good putts on the back nine,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited.

The striker, 20, scored three goals, including those in impressive victories against Sunderland and reigning champions Chelsea,\u00a0and has been chosen ahead of all the players in Division 1 and 2 based on his performance statistics. Panayiotou also netted a hat-trick in his third game for St Kitts and Nevis on international duty, and is looking to make an impression under Nigel Pearson at the King Power Stadium. Sportsmail held an exclusive Q&A with the\u00a0forward\u00a0after he found out about the accolade. Harry Panayiotou has scooped the Barclays Premier League U21 Player of the Month award for March . Congratulations, Harry. How would you describe your style of play at Leicester? Hold up play, roll the defender. And I've got a good burst of acceleration! Who do you look up to in the first team? Jeff (Schlupp). I grew up with Jeff so to see him come through the youth ranks, he's definitely my role model. Do you train with them often? I do, but not as much as I'd like to. Your record at Leicester reads one game, one goal. How did that come about? I was a first year and I scored 20 goals that season. They had nothing to play for [against Leeds] so they chucked me up there, and I came on and scored! How often do you speak to Nigel Pearson? Not too much this season, he's a busy guy! But when he has a chance to come talk to me, he comes and talks to me. Is your goal to make it at Leicester next season, or go out on loan? I'm Leicester born and bred and my goal is to make the first team, that's all I've ever wanted to do, it's not about going anywhere else to me. I'd love for us to stay in the Premier League, and I believe I can handle it. Panayiotou hopes to make Leicester City's first team in the Premier League and has grown up nearby . How do you relax away from football? Chill with my friends, I'm around some really good people. On to that international hat-trick... how did you get to play for St Kitts? My mum and grandma are from St Kitts, and my grandma passed away when I was younger - so making the choice to play for them came from the heart. What was the reaction when you came back? Everyone's jealous when I go away (laughs), but they were still really happy. U21 manager Steve [Beaglehole] couldn't stop looking at me for a week! Where did you play, and what was it like? Turks and Caicos. It was really hot! \u00a0When you go to the Caribbean, you either have to train at 7am or at night time. The players in the Caribbean are much stronger and really quick, so you have to think quick - that's all it is. Some of them aren't the best players but they have certainly got a lot of strength so you've got to adapt to that. Any St Kitts players you would tip to make it? Romaine Sawyers from Walsall, he's technically brilliant. I think he'll get a move this summer because he's really good. And our captain is doing great with FC Dallas in the MLS right now, Atiba Harris. There's a few others from England, who could definitely be higher up but they just haven't been seen. Panayiotou posted this picture on Twitter with the caption 'motherland' while he was away on international duty . Last album you listened to? I went to the Nicki Minaj concert the other day [in Nottingham[ so has to be The Pink Print . Last film? Fast and furious 7... emotional to be fair. Last holiday (apart from your international break!)? Egypt . A player you would tip to make it at Leicester? Ben Chilwell (England U19 international) Best advice you've received from a first team player? I remember Andy King once speaking to me. He said when you come and make an impression, don't worry about what anyone has to say and just make sure you're seen. Keep working hard, going to the gym, keep practicing. Best player you've ever played against? Sammy Ameobi, he's got great feet, we played him a tournament a couple of years ago. For how tall he is it's actually amazing, and his finishing is on point! What would you be doing if you weren't a footballer? I've always seen myself as a footballer. Nothing else. Maybe I'd be in the Caribbean, it's just peaceful.

He knew Jose Mourinho considered him \u2018unmanageable\u2019 and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at Manchester City. But Rodgers rather hoped Balotelli might be maturing with age, and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him. Mario Balotelli has no future at Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers lost patience with the striker . Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped Balotelli was maturing as he got older . Balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn . Liverpool\u2019s manager was desperate too, of course. Attempts to recruit other strikers, in particular Alexis Sanchez, had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that Rickie Lambert would not provide ample cover in a Champions League season if Daniel Sturridge suffered further injury problems. He was right to worry about Sturridge\u2019s physical fragility but wrong, he would probably now concede, to spend \u00a316million on Balotelli. For three hours in his office at Melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money. He spoke both to Balotelli and his agent, explaining what was expected of every Liverpool player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective. Over the years his C.O.R.E principles speech \u2013 Commitment. Ownership. Responsibilities. Excellence \u2013 had worked with players. He would use a flip-chart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and, for the most part, players had responded accordingly. But not Balotelli. Not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority, for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents. Liverpool missed out on Alexis Sanchez last summer and instead paid \u00a316m to sign Balotelli from AC Milan .

Rodgers is saddened by the fact that Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool, and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions. In Sturridge\u2019s absence Rodgers told Balotelli he needed a striker who would \u2018press\u2019 at the point of Liverpool\u2019s attack; who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of Liverpool\u2019s play. Balotelli, much to his manager\u2019s frustration, just wouldn\u2019t do it, in the misguided belief that he knew better. On the training field there have been similar issues; a situation that has offended team-mates who do buy into Rodgers\u2019 methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season. So there will be no second chance for Balotelli at Liverpool next season; no opportunity to redeem himself. Rodgers is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer. He has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use, if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did.

Coutinho has arguably been Liverpool's best player over the last five months having not only finally seemed to have grown in stature as a playmaker but also adding goals to his armoury. 'I have known him for a very long time and I know what he's capable of doing,' Lucas told liverpoolfc.com. 'He's becoming an even bigger player for the club and he's got a long way to go in terms of age and experience, but he's already right there with the top players.' Another player whose form has taken a significant upturn during that period is goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who produced two excellent saves to keep a clean sheet against Rovers and even stopped opposite number Simon Eastwood scoring what would have been the most dramatic of equalisers after the Rovers keeper came up for a throw-in in added time. The Belgium international has overcome his early-season wobbles when he seemed to be the cause of much of Liverpool's defensive frailties. He admits victory over Blackburn was important after back-to-back Premier League defeats put a huge dent in their Champions League aspirations. 'After the result against Arsenal there wasn't much time to think because we knew there was going to be a game on Wednesday,' Mignolet said. 'So we had to recover well, put the focus to Blackburn and then make sure that we did the things we wanted to do. 'I think the lads and the team responded really well, did their jobs and did what the gaffer asked us to do, and we managed to get the result we wanted. 'We needed to bounce back after two disappointing results against Manchester United and Arsenal and we did that. 'We gave something back to the fans, who have got something to look forward to now as well with a trip to Wembley.

{"input": "Hibs, Hearts and Rangers united in condemnation of the SPFL's decision to move the Ibrox club's final game of the Championship season back 24 hours. In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 \u2014 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes . Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that \u2014 as organisers of the competition \u2014 the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the 'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3 . 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change . 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well. Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time.

PSG beat Ligue 1 bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille 3-2, thrashed St Etienne 4-1 in the French Cup semi-finals, and won the League Cup final 4-0 against Bastia on Saturday.

We worked physically (during the winter break) and today, in money time, we're good,' said coach Laurent Blanc. 'We are gaining momentum while last year at the same time we were on the way down.' Both teams have been meeting regularly recently in the Champions League, with PSG beating Barca 3-2 at home in a Group F game this season before losing 3-1 at the Camp Nou. The Ligue 1 Champions will also have to cope without the injured David Luiz against the La Liga giants . Barca had reached the semi-finals in 2013 by eliminating PSG on away goals, drawing 1-1 at home after a 2-2 stalemate in Paris.

Barca's 2-2 draw at Sevilla in La Liga on Saturday, when they threw away a 2-0 lead, prompted renewed concerns about their defensive frailty, with both the concedded goals down to mistakes from the Barca rearguard. Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo made an uncharacteristic handling error to let in Ever Banega's long-range strike before halftime and centre back Gerard Pique's loss of possession in midfield led to the Andalusian club's late equaliser. Brazilian right back Dani Alves is suspended for the Champions League clash with the Ligue 1 outfit . The stalemate in Sevilla meant Barca's lead over second-placed Real Madrid at the top of La Liga was cut to two points but they remain on course to repeat the 2009 historic treble of Champions League and Spanish league and Cup. Barca's Brazil right back Dani Alves is suspended for Wednesday's game, with Adriano or Martin Montoya likely to replace him in the starting lineup. Pique, however, is unfazed as Barca would once again bank on their formidable attacking trio. 'I've never before seen a relationship like the one between Luis (Suarez), Ney (Neymar) and Leo (Messi).

The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough.

'We haven't set an outcome target, in terms of points we're going to get, but we have talked about the standards that we've set and that we need to maintain those. 'If we maintain them, then our position might surprise a few. Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring Palace's winning goal in their 2-1 victory against champions City .

He said: 'All our players are going to be looked at in a kinder manner, or through a different lens to how they've been looked at - and so they should be. 'Our form is as good as the top three or four clubs in the country and therefore they should receive the plaudits for what they're doing. That would be only what they deserve.' Mile Jedinak could come straight in after his four-game suspension as midfielder Joe Ledley is a doubt with a hip injury. Pardew added: 'Joe Ledley's got a slight strain and we'll have to monitor that. 'He's been exceptional since I've been here, so we'll give him every opportunity to play.' Pardew, after four years as Newcastle boss, knows Sunderland well and was not surprised the Black Cats turned to former Rangers and Holland boss Dick Advocaat. 'I think it was a great move for them to have someone of his experience at this time and he's proving that,' Pardew added. 'It's fair to say they've gone a little bit more direct, a little bit more positive. 'They have some good players and it's always a difficult place to go. 'I don't think we're under an illusions.

As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May. It is an infuriating situation, the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of Malky Mackay incurable this season.

Scorers: Pennant 22, Pearce 69 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 15,994 . Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. Wigan showed guts and dug in for Caldwell, whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the Latics' official Twitter account midway through this. It felt like a sly dig to his predecessor. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . And to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under Mackay. Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. Smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rained down on Symons. The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place.

Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a 'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday . Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return . He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.", "answer": "Kevin Pietersen made 170 runs of 149 balls for Surrey in Oxford on Sunday .\nAlec Stewart says the batsman can make it difficult for England selectors .\nPietersen believes Paul Downton's departure has given him a 'lifeline'\nEngland started the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua on Monday .", "completion": ["Kevin Pietersen, England's exiled record run-scorer, is being urged to make the England selectors' lives difficult after his impressive start to the summer, scoring 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday."]}
{"input": "Glowing tributes were paid yesterday to cricketing legend Richie Benaud, after his death at 84 from skin cancer. At Lord\u2019s, MCC flags were lowered, and the Australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a Test series as his country\u2019s captain, then became a commentator. David Cameron said he had \u2018grown up listening to Richie Benaud\u2019s wonderful cricket commentary\u2019, while his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott called it \u2018a sad day for Australia\u2019. Retiring as a player in 1964, Benaud\u2019s masterful analysis was universally revered. Here, we reproduce a tribute paid by the Mail\u2019s brilliant sports columnist IAN WOOLDRIDGE \u2014 which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in England switched from terrestrial to satellite TV, depriving cricket fans of Benaud\u2019s voice . . . Richie Benaud in the commentary box at the Oval for the final test of the 2005 Ashes. Thereafter international cricket fans in England lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite TV . So it is farewell, then, to the Master of Measured Words. Richie Benaud will not be returning to England next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket\u2019s finest commentator. That is not merely my judgment. A recent poll by The Wisden Cricketer magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes. Precisely 10,128 of them nominated Benaud as the best. Fortunately, he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success, particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of Tower of Babel verbiage. He does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom. He names no names. He is too polite for that. Nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years. At 74, Benaud is still as fit as a flea, the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating. Yes, there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us, but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party, check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce: \u2018Thank you very much. We\u2019re off.\u2019 At sunrise next morning, he and Daphne, his elegant and unfailingly supportive English wife, will be striding out on their three-mile constitutional. Benaud representing Australia in 1961. He led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series . He is meticulous in all things. On TV commentary days, even Daphne is not allowed to iron his shirts. He presses them himself. He is a food faddist, preparing his Test match lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating. Once, he took a week-long course in Italy to learn how to cook pasta to perfection. His desks at his homes in London, South of France and Sydney are polished plateaux of precision, his reference-book shelves indexed for instant reach. It is this unrelenting self-discipline, instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother \u2014 there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with Richie and his Test cricketer brother John in the book \u2014 that launched him into his dual career life. The first, of course, was in cricket, where to haul oneself from school, to club, to State, the Australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb. Benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. Such was his cunning as a wrist-spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked. In fact, he became the first, in an era when far fewer Tests were played, to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. But what next? All of seven years before he retired from cricket, Benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry. There was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper, where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story. It was an important lesson. Then a curious opportunity, which couldn\u2019t happen in today\u2019s schedules, presented itself. At the end of Australia\u2019s 1956 tour to England, all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the British Isles. Australian captain Richie Benaud takes on the MCC in the first innings at Brisbane on December 5, 1958 . Benaud proceeded otherwise. At his own expense he moved from the Kensington Palace Hotel into a cramped lower ground room in the RAC club in Pall Mall and took a BBC television training course, alongside directors, commentators, even audiences, to learn how television worked. He trailed Peter O\u2019Sullevan at Newbury and he studied the commentating techniques of Henry Longhurst on golf and Dan Maskell on tennis. All three had their idiosyncrasies, but one thing they had in common. O\u2019Sullevan, voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race, was circumspect about collateral chatter, just as Longhurst and \u2018Oh I say\u2019 Maskell knew the value of golden silence. Indeed, one of Longhurst\u2019s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom: \u2018Excuse me, Henry, but are you still alive?\u2019 Benaud now says: \u2018I didn\u2019t know if I had a future in broadcasting. If I hadn\u2019t done that BBC course my life would have been very different, even though I had to wait for seven years for my chance. \u2018The key feature it taught me was the economy of words. Never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves. Only add to it if you had something pertinent to say.\u2019 Benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between England and Australia at Lord's during the 2009 Ashes . These days if only. Has he ever made a bloomer? Of course, like all of us, he has. On one celebrated occasion, handing over from a Test match for a news update from Moira Stuart, he called her Moira Shearer, the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film. When Moira Stuart handed back he said: \u2018Thanks, Moira, our newsreader wearing Red Shoes.\u2019 Many, who had not heard his initial blunder, wondered what on earth he was on about. \u2018At the time,\u2019 he recalls, \u2018I thought it was a pretty clever remark, but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant. It taught me never to be such a smart-arse again.\u2019 Laconic, economic, massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a Test match, I wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television? Many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone. Very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator.", "answer": "International cricket fans in England lost legend's voice after 2005 Ashes .\nThis led Ian Wooldridge to pay homage to 'cricket's finest commentator'\nAs a player he led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series .\nMantra of 'never insulting the viewers' by saying too much made him great .", "completion": ["Cricketing legend Richie Benaud, who never lost a Test series as Australia's captain and later became a renowned commentator, has died at 84 from skin cancer, prompting tributes from around the world and an offer of a state funeral from the Australian government."]}

I felt that Forest put us under a lot of pressure in the first 20 minutes, a lot of energy, the crowd were right behind them. We defended well in that period, very well. Then we came through it and started to look a threat ourselves. 'Then just after half time, Afobe's scored a fantastic goal that, in a tight game, has put our noses in front.

{"input": "Manchester City\u2019s problems are not confined to the Barclays Premier League. Over the pond, New York City FC manager Jason Kreis is finding life increasingly difficult following a patchy start to the season which continued on Thursday night as Philadelphia Union snatched a late draw in a match which had been bossed for long periods by the men in sky blue. The pressure hasn\u2019t reached Manuel Pellegrini proportions. It's too early for that. New York City FC's Mehdi Ballouchy opened the scoring before his side were pegged back . Yet Kreis and NYCFC will be under no illusions about the task in hand. Things need to improve. And fast. A superb second half strike from Mehdi Ballouchy looked to have put an end to a run of just one win from the first five matches. But, as is ever the case in MLS, haphazard defending allowed CJ Sapong to stab in on 86 minutes. As long as David Villa stays fit - he came off at halftime with a hamstring strain here - and the squad continues to gel, Frank Lampard will arrive here in the summer and join a side who slowly but surely will have adapted to the task in hand by then. This though was a reminder of how much work needs to be done. The Big Apple sports fans have been quick to adopt City\u2019s plans though it will take more time \u2013 and a more wins \u2013 for the club to really catch light. They will never, and don\u2019t expect to compare to the might of the Yankees, Knicks, Jets or Giants. They are sporting titans in a city bursting with stars. Certainly a look around Yankees Stadium at kick-off was all you needed to see that the initial spike of interest in NYCFC has quickly dimmed. David Villa was forced off with a hamstring injury at half time on Thursday night . The opening game attendance of over 60,000 seemed like a hazy distant memory. It\u2019s another reminder, not that the club bosses required one, of the desperate need for a permanent football specific home. But, to be fair, as the game wore on the atmosphere and excitement was enough to leave the attendees wanting more even if the League itself does little to help the product on the pitch. MLS needs to start acknowledging international breaks like everyone else. City\u2019 s Mix Diskerud, arguably their best player thus far, was unavailable having played for the US in their win over Mexico on Wednesday night while the likes Robbie Keane missed League matches during the last round of Euro 2016 qualifier. That cannot help the progress of the game here. Another quirk this side of the pond saw Philadelphia lock horns with Kreis\u2019 side just four days after beating them at home 2-1. It\u2019s perhaps an attempt to recreate the mini-series of matches like in baseball. City, though, created nothing of note early on. David Villa\u2019s second MLS strike in Philadelphia had brought his side level before Vincent Nogueira slotted home a late winner yet the Spanish star was feeding off scraps here. Indeed the chances were falling at the other end of the pitch, Venezuelan striker Fernando Aristeguieta firing just over to keep the stuttering home side firmly on their toes. Villa sparked into life every time the ball fell at his feet yet his markers weren\u2019t giving an inch. Three surrounded the former Barcelona forward on 25 minutes and after he was ushered out of play, full-back Sheanon Williams needed no invitation to get stuck into the Spaniard by pushing his square in the chest. New York City have made a slow start to the MLS season, winning just once . It was handbags at best. Yet it showed just how wary Union were of Villa\u2019s class. And on 27 minutes, the first moment of magic should have resulted in the opener. A sweet flick from the 33 year-old beautifully teed up Ballouchy only for the Moroccan to blaze over. He really should have scored. It goes without saying that Villa was emphatically the best player on the pitch. A canny dummy helped split the Philadelphia backline in half but Khiry Shelton couldn\u2019t get round keeper John McCarthy. Kreis needed the rest of the team to start performing after the break though. And , to their credit, they did. Ned Grabavoy was denied by McCarthy\u2019s outstretched leg before Adam Nemec headed wide. Finally there was some urgency and on 57 minutes, there was a goal. It was a superb strike by Ballouchy who cut inside with an excellent first touch before curling home. Philadelphia though, home of Rocky Balboa, stayed strong before delivering that late knock-out blow. Perhaps Kreis should give Pellegrini a call at some point soon. Both are enduring tough times.", "answer": "New York City FC's patchy start to the season continued .\nMehdi Ballouchy put the home side ahead but CJ Sapong levelled late on .\nCity have won just one of their opening six matches in MLS .\nDavid Villa was forced off at half time with a hamstring strain .", "completion": ["New York City FC manager Jason Kreis is facing challenges following a patchy start to the season, with a late draw against Philadelphia Union adding to the pressure."]}

Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund.

{"input": "He scored the two goals at the Etihad that saw off Manchester City in the last 16, he scored in the Clasico to leave the league title in Barcelona's hands, and with two more goals on Wednesday in the Parc des Princes, Luis Suarez put his team practically in the Champions League semi-finals. He is starting to look like \u00a375million very well spent \u2013 especially in view of the fact that David Luiz, the man he nutmegged twice en route to both goals on Wednesday, cost \u00a350m. The Spanish call the nutmeg a 'tunnel' and  in Catalonia they are hailing the 'Eurotunnels' that have led Barcelona to within two games of the Berlin final on June 6. Luis Suarez curls the ball home for his second and Barcelona's third against Paris Saint-Germain . Suarez celebrates with Neymar as Barcelona took a giant step towards the Champions League semi-finals . Suarez started the season late because of his FIFA ban and, on his own admission, was anxious in front of goal when he first joined Neymar and Lionel Messi \u2013 too conscious of the need not to appear greedy in the company of two world-class finishers. But now the numbers speak for themselves. He has scored 13 goals in his last 14 games \u2013 six from six in the Champions League. His overall tally is 18 and Bar\u00e7a's front three are on 91 for the season. They look set to eclipse arguably the club's greatest front three of Messi, Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry who scored 100 goals in the 2008-09 campaign. They also look to have even more about them than the Real Madrid trio of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo who won the Champions League last season. The ease with with which Suarez has fitted into Barcelona's front three should not be underestimated. Rio Ferdinand tweeted: 'Suarez does the dirty work for Messi & Neymar without losing any quality'. Suarez's relationship with Lionel Messi both on and off the field has blossomed in recent months . Suarez, Neymar and Messi have established themselves as the most feared front three in the world . And it's true that he batters defenders and tirelessly runs the channels, freeing up space for his Brazilian and Argentine team-mates. But it's no longer about Suarez applying the body shots and Neymar and Messi landing the knockout punch \u2013 he is now getting the winning goals himself. 'We have seen him do it before for Ajax and Liverpool,' said Luis Enrique after Wednesday's game. Suarez now has 15 goals in 2015 \u2013 almost twice as many as the eight managed by Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini between them. He has also stayed clear of controversy. Last week he gave an in-depth radio interview with Cadena Cope and even made a light-hearted reference to the nonsensical action at the World Cup that cost him his place in the tournament and in this summer's Copa America. 'I was going to say we have a very special hunger but I had better use another word,' he said when asked about what sets Uruguayan players apart. He hates the biting pun headlines but after such a wonderful night in Paris he might let references in Diario AS to American Werewolf in Paris pass, especially the line that read, 'seeing David Luiz come on to the pitch must have been like a full moon to a werewolf'. Suarez enjoyed great success against David Luiz, twice nutmegging the former Chelsea player . Luiz was made to look rather ordinary by the Barcelona forward as he struggled on his return from injury . It's true he devoured Luiz, as he scored goal numbers 1,000 and 1,001 in Barcelona's history in European competition. There was a touch of the Samuel Eto'o about the goal too. It revived memories of Eto'o's strike in Rome 2009 against Manchester United. After nutmegging Luiz, the way Suarez combined that light touch with the use of his upper-body strength to repel Marquinhos and Maxwell was the perfect illustration of how he pairs the physical attributes of a centre forward, with the quick feet of a winger. It was another goal scored cutting in from the right much like the second he scored against England in Brazil at the World Cup. He began his Barca career on the right with Messi playing through the middle but admitted last week that in one game Messi switched places with him and told him to stay through the middle. Part of his remit is to dovetail with the four-times Ballon d'Or winner. If Messi plays centrally then he runs the right-hand channel. If Messi wants to hug the right touchline, then he plays through the middle. He was often as accommodating at Liverpool with Sturridge so he was never going to say no to Messi. Suarez was accommodating when he played with Daniel Sturridge at Liverpool last season . The degree to which those two, and the younger more frivolous Neymar have got along together off the pitch has helped them gel so quickly on it. Did you hear the one about the Uruguayan, the Brazilian and the Argentine sounds like the start of a joke - on Wednesday the defenders trying to cope with them will not have seen the funny side. 'It's not over,' he said after the game when asked about next week's second leg. And he also said he nutmegged Luiz because 'it was the only way to get past him'. He knows there are 90 minutes more to negotiate before Barcelona can celebrate reaching the final four. It wouldn't do to linger too long on how he had destroyed the world's most expensive defender \u2013 the replays of those two goals will do that on their own.", "answer": "Luis Suarez scored twice as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 .\nThe Uruguayan had a slow start at the club but is now in impressive form .\nHe has scored 13 goals in his last 14 games and six from six in Europe .\nHis relationship with Lionel Messi and Neymar has reaped rewards .", "completion": ["Luis Suarez scored two goals in the Champions League semi-finals, leading Barcelona to victory and demonstrating his worth as a \u00a375million investment."]}

The 26-year-old Holland international midfielder played 45 minutes for the club's Under-21s team on Wednesday evening after competing his recovery from surgery to repair a collapsed lung. Head coach John Carver has hinted that De Jong could even make the 18 for Sunday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Tottenham at St James' Park, and while the Dutchman has not ruled that out, his sights are set the Swans' visit to Tyneside on the following weekend. Newcastle playmaker Siem de Jong is hopeful of returning to the first-team before the end of the season .

'We'll see how it goes. I still have to get a little bit stronger, a little bit more explosive, a little faster, and hopefully I can work on that in the coming days.'

The summer signing has been plagued by injuries since arriving from Ajax but  is close to full fitness . Injury hit when he badly tore a thigh muscle in training days later and was sidelined until February, when disaster struck once again as he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career. He took the first tentative steps towards a first-team return at St James' Park on Wednesday evening, and while he knows there is more hard work to be done, he is glad to be back and already looking towards the start of next season. De Jong said: 'I haven't repaid the fans a lot this season, so I hope to be playing a couple of games, maybe, at the end of the season. 'But I have to focus on next season and be really fit then and hopefully I can show the fans what I can do, and show myself and show my team-mates what I can do.'

The 21-year-old lives who on a 30-acre farm in Rockbank, 34 kilometres north-west of Melbourne, has spent her life hand-raising animals of all shapes and sizes. But her pets are often captured behaving like humans, from her lamb Winter who loves to jump on the bed to her bearded dragon who can understand the English language. Thanks to this Ms Hussein's collection of creatures have become somewhat of an internet sensation. The young woman said she has always taken photos and recorded videos of her 150 pets, but since a clip of Winter bouncing down her hallway went viral last year she's sharing these moments with more people than she ever imagined. 'As long as I can remember I had photographed and videoed my pets but only until I started Vine, did I really start posting what I captured,' the young woman told Daily Mail Australia.

Many of her animals have formed unlikely friendships, like this pug Amani and piglet Ms Hussein raised . On her parents' hobby farm Ms Hussein spends her days playing with, feeding, and caring for what she estimates to be at least 150 different animals. Her social media accounts are filled with cute and quirky snapshots of some of the animals' unique behaviours. Some moments captured include Winter bouncing up and down on the bed, him pushing Leo the cat off a chair, and then curling up with his feline friend for a nap. Winter also runs across the yard to Ms Hussein when he's called, headbutts chairs, bleats loudly, and snuggles ducklings. Liz the bearded dragon can understand English and nods when she wants something to eat, while baby ducklings follow their carer around the yard when they're called.

Ms Hussein's cats like to watch as she feeds the turtles, and Ozzie the emu which used to live on the farm liked to chase sheep. The young woman said although she does have other interests, much of her time is spent outside watching all that unfolds. 'In the warmer weather I'm usually out the door and outside and spending time with all the baby animals,' she said. 'In spring it's the craziest, we have baby animals everywhere. 'There was a time where we had baby ducks, baby geese and even baby emus and they were following me everywhere, it was so cute,' Ms Hussein added. Most of the animals on the farm get on well apart from the few that have to be kept separate, and some unlikely friendships have formed between many different species. 'We can't have the dogs with most of the animals, the cats are fine with all the animals except for the rabbits and the mice,' the young woman revealed.

For Ms Hussein, a life surrounded by a whole lot of different creatures is the only one she knows, and she says it's always filled with surprises. 'From a very young age I was taught how to care for baby animals and how to properly handle them. 'One of the earliest animals i got the chance of hand rearing that I can remember was a baby cockatiel which had been abandoned by her mum, and still have to this day, it's name is Squeaky,' she said. And while much of her day is spent filled with cuddles and funny moments, life on her farm isn't always fun and games. 'I spend quite a bit of time cleaning and feeding my animals, some of which need to be fed multiple times a day,' Ms Hussein revealed. ' 'My parents are a big help and often help me with the animals when needed as well as caring for the bigger animals outside and their own pets.' Ms Hussein also has two Akitas, Kumi and Rambo .

Some of the 21-year-old's favourite moments growing up include: 'a pet turkey which gave handshakes, a possum that slept in my bed, different species of animals interacting and enjoying each other's company'. For years she simply kept all these memories to herself, but now she has realised there is a whole audience of people who want to share these moments too. One video of Ms Hussein's lamb Winter has almost 40 million loops, and is still climbing more than eight months later. 'I was just so shocked at the attention my Vines attracted, I was only expecting to share my clips with a small audience.' Vine is a video sharing app which allows users to post six second long clips. They can be reposted, commented on and views are counted in 'loops'. When originally posted, the video of Winter bounding down the hallway of the house was shared by Taylor Swift, Ashton Kutcher, Ariana Grande and picked up by Ellen Degeneres and MTV.

Perhaps the goalkeeper would have been better off hiding behind conventional wisdom, considering the disappointment of this elongated campaign which could yet see Everton finish in the bottom half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. Those prospects are dwindling, courtesy of a four-game unbeaten run, but there is no mistaking that Roberto Martinez\u2019s side have fallen way below the standards set last season. The gap between their status now and after 32 games last season is 25 points, the difference between targeting a Champions League place and chasing the top 10.

The demands of playing 10 games in the Europa League have certainly taken their toll but Howard rejected that theory, saying: \u2018That\u2019s something that\u2019s been talked about for the last five or 10 years but it\u2019s just a blanket statement people make. Champions League teams have to do the same thing. \u2018They play Wednesday and Saturday and it\u2019s tough but no-one blames Champions League football.

Martinez was incensed by the award of a penalty though it appeared a reasonable decision. Neither side came out of the fixture unscathed, with Leon Osman of Everton and Swansea City\u2019s Bafetimbi Gomis due to have scans today on respective groin and hamstring injuries.

Cole's contract expires at the end of the season and it is unclear whether he'll stay at the club beyond the summer. But Cole admits he's in no position to ask his boss about an extension with Allardyce's future also in limbo. Carlton Cole attended a Football Fighting Ebola event with Nathaniel Clyne on Sunday . Cole's contract expires at the end of the season and is unsure if he will be offered a new deal . Like Cole, the manager's contract expires in the summer and it is looking increasingly likely he'll leave West Ham. And the 31-year-old striker said: 'I've not spoken to the manager about a new contract, I don\u2019t think Sam knows what he is doing. He isn't going to be talking about my contract.' Cole, who came close to joining West Brom in January before Allardyce pulled the plug on the deal 20 minutes before the deadline after his attempts to sign Emmanuel Adebayor failed, admits he is making contingency plans in case his Hammers career comes to an end this summer. 'I have been at West Ham for 10 years, I\u2019m trying to build a case to get a testimonial out of them but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to be talking about right now,' said Cole.

{"input": "West Ham manager Sam Allardyce conceded that his side are suffering from a psychological problem after Marko Arnautovic's 95th-minute equaliser saw the Hammers drop points for the second game in a row. Allardyce's side had been on track for their first back-to-back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside, Arnautovic eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw. Aaron Cresswell had given the home side an early lead at Upton Park but after a strong start it was Stoke who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point.

It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

West Ham were well on top, and Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes. But as the half wore on it was Stoke who looked the more likely to score. Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

Minutes later Arnautovic had the ball in the net, slotting past Adrian, but his run was correctly flagged for offside. The Spanish keeper's goal seemed to be living a charmed life and particularly so as Stoke went within an inch of equalising. Jonathan Walters sent in a cross from the right that was met by the unmarked head of substitute Mame Biram Diouf, who powered an effort towards goal only to see it bounce off the inside of the post, along the goal line and somehow staying out. West Ham looked like throwing it all away again late on. Arnautovic found Adrian's net for a second time but was again flagged for offside. But the Austrian wasn't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. Stephen Ireland flicked the ball on and Arnautovic applied the finish, slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support. Stoke manager Mark Hughes said: 'It looked for a long time that we weren't going to be able to do it.

And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love.

Table courtesy of Opta . However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp . Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000 . Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal . Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009 . Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011 . Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half.\u00a0David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United . Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off.

{"input": "Barcelona threw away a two-goal lead against Sevilla thanks to individual errors by Claudio Bravo and Gerard Pique, which leaves them just two points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. It was a cruel twist of fate for Bravo and Pique, both of whom have been outstanding in the second half of the season and the effort on Sevilla's part was momentous. A year ago Barcelona travelled to Andalusia to face Granada and left a beaten side, their title challenge hitting an iceberg. This was not as brutal a blow, but Enrique\u2019s team will need to right themselves quickly ahead of a testing fortnight. Lionel Messi (left) celebrates scoring the opening goal with Neymar . Sevilla: Sergio Rico, Coke, Carrico, Pareja, Tremoulinas, Krychowiak, Banega, Iborra (Mbia 70), Aleix Vidal, Bacca (Gameiro 75), Vitolo (Reyes 70). Subs not used: David Soria, Navarro, Diogo, D Suarez. Goals: Banega 37, Gameiro 83. Booked: Iborra, Reyes, Mbia, Krychowiak, Banega. Barcelona: Bravo, Alves, Pique, Mathieu, Alba, Busquets, Rakitic, Iniesta (Pedro 85), Messi, Suarez, Neymar (Xavi 73). Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Pedro, Rafinha, Mascherano, Bartra, Adriano. Goals: Messi 14, Neymar 31. Booked: Busquets, Pique. Ref: Juan Martinez Munuera. Goals from Lionel Messi and Neymar looked to have ended Sevilla\u2019s amazing 14-month unbeaten home record in La Liga, but Unai Emery\u2019s men showed why they are so hard to beat with a momentous comeback. Gerard Deulofeu was dropped from Sevilla's squad and Denis Suarez started on the bench. To be able to leave out two Barcelona loanees shows the strength in depth that the coach has. It also shows how Sevilla won the Europa League last season and why they are aiming to reach the Champions League this year. A big part of their European triumph last season was down to their captain Ivan Rakitic. Enough, in fact, that Barcelona decided to pluck him from Emery's ranks and give him a bigger stage to shine on. Rakitic says he still holds Sevilla in his heart, thanks to his four season spell in Andalusia. Perhaps his history confused him early on, with the Croat playing a terrible ball back towards his own box which didn\u2019t cost Barcelona, thanks to the referee deciding he was fouled after releasing it. Messi curled home a trademark left-footed shot against Sevilla . Real Madrid had already done their part on Saturday afternoon, seeing off Eibar at the Santiago Bernabeu and then desperately hoped Sevilla would be able to do theirs. Something had to give at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, whether it was Sevilla's streak, or Barcelona's nine-game winning run. It was Barcelona who last did the damage here in February 2014, but they could not do it again. Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Neymar were brought back into the Barcelona side after missing Wednesday's win against Almeria, through injury, suspension and rotation respectively. The latter had a point to prove after a run of fruitless games, where he\u2019s been more likely to cause a fight than score a goal. That wasn\u2019t the case here. Neymar hit a beautifully struck free-kick from the left, to double Barcelona\u2019s lead after half-an-hour. Messi had opened the scoring, with a goal similar to his strike in mid-week. Neymar fed the ball into the Argentine on the right-hand side of the box, who took a touch to work some space and then curled the ball sweetly around the outstretched arm of Sergio Rico and into the top left corner. The Argentine forward took his season's tally to 34 goals in La Liga . Sevilla are good opponents for Messi, who has scored more goals against them than any other side, bar Atletico Madrid. And it was Sevilla he hit a hat-trick against at the Camp Nou earlier this season, the game where he overtook Telmo Zarra\u2019s all-time record of 251 goals. When the big games have come around this season, Barcelona have brought their big game. Dani Alves, for example, has not had a good season, but when the chips are down he\u2019s dug deep. This could be the last time he plays against Sevilla, his former side, and he evoked memories of his former self, charging up the right but getting back when needed as well. However, Sevilla got themselves back in the game before the break with a long-range drive from Ever Banega, the Argentine midfielder who has been reinvigorated under Emery\u2019s watchful eye. Netmar doubled Barcelona's lead with a curling free kick into the top corner . On a day of goalkeeping errors in Spain you suspected it would be third-choice Sevilla stopper Sergio Rico adding to the list, rather than Barcelona\u2019s Claudio Bravo, but that was not the case. The latter is on course to beat Thibaut Courtois\u2019 Zamora Trophy winning 20 clean sheets from last season, with 17 so far, but could not add to his tally here. Bravo got a hand to Banega\u2019s strike but only succeeded in tipping it in off the post, rather than around it. Barcelona had chances to extend their lead, with Messi seeing a free kick tipped over, and Luis Suarez culpable of missing two huge opportunities. He blazed both over the crossbar, either side of the half-time interval. The first he was off-balance for and the angle was tricky, but the second was a golden chance. Andres Iniesta saw his shot saved by Rico, but Suarez couldn\u2019t find the empty net with the rebound. But the Catalan side weren\u2019t creating chances at will; this was hard work against durable, cunning opponents. Krychowiak made a quite phenomenal tackle on Messi which typified the sprit Sevilla showed both in this encounter and throughout the season. With the No 10 running at Sevilla's defence, the Pole fought back, eventually committing himself to a sliding challenge, from which he emerged with the ball, and started a break. Luis Suarez (left) shoots past Sevilla midfielder Daniel Carrico . Carlos Bacca \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar aside, La Liga\u2019s most proflific forward this season \u2013 went close when he whistled a strike over the top of Bravo\u2019s goal, while Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets were both booked for stopping lightning-quick attacks. It wasn\u2019t enough. Emery undid Barcelona with three substitutions, all of which paid dividends. Jose Antonio Reyes played a big part in the equaliser, which was converted by another substitute, Kevin Gameiro. Gerard Pique gave the ball away and Reyes combined with Vitolo, before Gameiro side-footed home a low, scuttled cross at the far post, to ignite the stadium. What makes things worse for Barcelona is that this game is just the start of a brutal fortnight. Enrique\u2019s side travel to Paris to play PSG on Wednesday, before hosting high-flying Valencia on Saturday. Then it\u2019s PSG again three days later, before a Catalan derby at Espanyol. By that time, they may even be playing catch-up. One crumb of comfort for Enrique though. Real Madrid still have to come to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and to a man, Barcelona\u2019s side will testify to the difficulty of emerging with three points.

{"input": "Barcelona took a major step towards qualification for the last four of the Champions League after they dismantled Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night. Sportsmail's ADAM CRAFTON takes a look at five things we learned from Barcelona's\u00a0emphatic\u00a0 victory. Super Suarez . It feels rather strange now but there was a time last summer when we were all wondering whether Luis Suarez - with his penchant for a human-based snack during football matches - was worth all that money for Barcelona. There can be no question anymore. It is now 17 goals for the season and Barcelona's front three, spearheaded by Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar is the most in-form in world football. They are a frightening prospect and Suarez, after three goals in his first 12 games for Barcelona, has hit the high notes at the right time. He has scored 10 in his last 11 games - including two crucial goals away at Manchester City - and his understanding with his strike partners has elevated this Barcelona side to a new level. Luis Suarez scores his second of the night to give Barcelona a 3-0 lead in their tie at Paris Saint-Germain . The former Liverpool forward is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after doubling his tally for the evening . PSG yearn for Zlatan's quality . Prior to this game, PSG were unbeaten so far this season when playing without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, winning 11 and drawing 5 of the 16 games. It had developed a view - nourished by that inspiring performance when Ibrahbimovic was sent off at Chelsea - that PSG may be a stronger collective unit without the Swede. Yet on the grandest occasions, you still require that moment of world-class quality and Laurent Blanc really needed Edinson Cavani to stand tall here. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, pictured in action on Saturday, missed the game against Barcelona through suspension . Edinson Cavani failed to deliver the goods for PSG and looked out-of-sorts against Barcelona on Wednesday . Once more, though, the Uruguayan failed to deliver on the biggest stage. PSG fans still wince at the memory of his miss against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last season and so often, he leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games. He was brilliantly denied by a Javier Mascherano challenge in the first half but you sensed he lacked the conviction to really make the most of the opportunity. He does some wonderful things, moving with pace and intelligence but when faced with a guilt-edged opening, he too often loses that defining ability to remain cool and detached when faced by a goalkeeper and the roar of the crowd. When bearing down on Mascherano in the first half, he was like a pianist whose timing has deserted him, hesitating and pontificating. It is now only four goals in 15 games and you can perhaps understand why PSG may be tempted to cash in on him. Neymar back in form . After a run of three goals in 10 games, the Brazilian had begun to fade into the shadows a little, particularly when placed against the the brilliance of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. The local rumour mill had begun swirling and there were suggestions - not without foundation - in the Catalan media that Neymar is unhappy with how often he is substituted by his manager. This was a good response. He remains such a talent and the opening goal tonight was clinically dispatched and marked his 28th goal of an excellent season. Messi was pulling the strings as ever but Neymar was the most eye-catching Barcelona forward in the first-half. Neymar was Barcelona's most eye-catching forward in the first half of their victory against PSG . Neymar celebrates with Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan scored his first of two goals against PSG . PSG's Euro home run comes to an end . This victory for Barcelona brought a shuddering end to PSG's proud unbeaten run at the Parc de Princes in European competition. Barcelona are the first team to win here in either the Europa League or Champions League since Hapoel Tel-Aviv in 2006 - an undefeated streak that had lasted nine years, yielding 22 wins and 11 draws. In truth, the victory was rarely in doubt from the first whistle, such was Barcelona's composure and quality on the ball. Sir Alex Ferguson once described the experience of facing Barcelona's passing game as like being on a 'carousel'. PSG started brightly and for a few moments, it looked like the carousel might have malfunctioned. But it was no more than a glitch. PSG hopped on and when the referee finally called time, they staggered off across the fairground, most probably feeling rather sick. Marquinhos and Yohan Cabaye reflect on PSG's defeat... their first at home in European football since 2006 . Busquets is the midfield maestro . We have marvelled for years at the gifts of Xavi and Andres Iniesta and while the shielding work of Sergio Busquets has also been appreciated, it does seem as though he has become even more prominent under Luis Enrique. He reads the game with such intelligence, stepping in with poise and composure to mop up the danger. Those around him - Iniesta, Rakitic and Xavi add the decoration - but Busquets' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of this Barcelona midfield. Every team is grateful to its 'water-carriers', as Eric Cantona once dubbed Didier Deschamps, but with Busquets in this form, Barcelona could be heading towards the champagne come the end of the season.

It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final . Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said. 'I think the league campaign has been disappointing. There is sort of a feeling of doom and gloom around the league campaign this year which is never nice. Reading have struggled in the Championship but have brought FA Cup euphoria to the town with their great run . 'I think that is reflected in the game (against Bournemouth), when we are knocking at the door in the last 10 minutes and knocking on the door very, very much. 'Bournemouth, because they're on a winning run, know how to get over the line and win at the moment.

{"input": "Louis van Gaal says the prospect of facing Aston Villa scared him more than the idea of taking on Manchester City at Old Trafford. United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'", "answer": "Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is not concerned about Man City .\nHe insists he feared facing Aston Villa because of their defensive set-up .\nVan Gaal dreams of beating rivals City in his first Old Trafford derby match .\nREAD: Wayne Rooney renaissance comes at perfect time for Man United .", "completion": ["Manchester United's Louis van Gaal is confident of victory against Manchester City, stating that he believes City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favor, and that teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat."]}
{"input": "Head coach John Carver admitted he was 'embarrassed' by Newcastle's capitulation at Sunderland after seeing his side slip to a fifth successive derby defeat. Jermain Defoe's stunning strike was enough to secure a 1-0 victory for the Black Cats, who eased their relegation fears with just a third Barclays Premier League win of the season at the Stadium of Light. The Magpies were desperately poor before the break and only marginally better after it to leave Geordie Carver red-faced. John Carver was left embarrassed after Newcastle United's 1-0 loss at Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Carver admitted Newcastle were second best in every department during a fifth straight derby defeat . Jermain Defoe scored a stunning volley for Sunderland to secure a vital win . He said: 'I am sitting here - do you think I'm embarrassed? I am absolutely embarrassed, yes I am. I am embarrassed to be part of it, yes, but I am a part of it and I have to deal with it. 'In the first-half, we were dreadful. I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not closing people down, not working hard enough and I think I was wrong. 'We were second-best in every department, certainly the midfield areas and the front three. 'But what I will say is with a makeshift back four, they stuck by their guns, along with the goalkeeper, and actually kept us in the game because without those guys, we would have been in big trouble. 'If we'd have got to half-time at 0-0, I actually would have been doing somersaults in the dressing room. That's how poor we were.' Defoe smashed home his superb volley in first-half stoppage time to secure Sunderland's victory . And Defoe's goals sparked delirious scenes at the Stadium of Light as Sunderland claimed a massive win . The victory over Newcastle moved Sunderland three points clear of the Premier League relegation zone . Defoe's superb volley in first-half stoppage time won the day for the Black Cats, who remained outside the relegation zone only by virtue of goal difference after Burnley's goalless draw with Tottenham earlier in the day. Defoe blasted the ball past stranded keeper Tim Krul after Steven Fletcher had headed down keeper Costel Pantilimon's long free-kick, but while Dick Advocaat's men enjoyed the better of the game throughout, they were unable to extend their lead. They had to endure a tense conclusion during which Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez volleyed over from close range. Advocaat was delighted with his team's effort and the quality they produced just when they needed it most, and was particularly pleased with the way Defoe and fellow frontmen Fletcher and Connor Wickham responded to his pre-match instructions.

{"input": "To mark the point at which Manchester United's season really began to turn around, you have to go back further than the win against Tottenham last month. The truth is that a dark, cold night at Preston North End in mid-February is more significant. United were poor that night in the FA Cup at Deepdale, coming from behind to win. That, however, was the night Wayne Rooney was restored to a centre-forward position, the night Louis van Gaal finally began to realise the best place from which his best player and captain should lead was from the front. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been returned to his preferred position up front . The 29-year-old had previously been deployed in midfield this season and United had struggled . Now, manager Louis van Gaal (left) looks set to unleash an in-form Rooney on Manchester City on Sunday . United actually lost their next game at Swansea but have subsequently won their next five in the league, with Rooney scoring four times. Incredibly, given the pattern of this season, they head into Sunday's derby game with Manchester City as slight favourites. Prior to that night in Lancashire, Rooney was on the verge of knocking on his manager's door to ask for an explanation about his deployment in the centre of midfield. It seemed as though Van Gaal was about to experience his first very real problem at Old Trafford. Whether he sniffed something in the air, we will never know. But Van Gaal performed a sharp volte face at just the right time and Rooney has gone on to become the most significant figure in United's return to relevance. At Old Trafford, just as he has since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Real Madrid almost six years ago, Rooney represents the most serious threat to City's prospects. Prior to the win over Tottenham, Rooney stood before his team-mates in Manchester's Lowry Hotel and delivered an impassioned call to arms. He is once more the central figure at his club, in more ways than one. 'I think some people mix up scoring goals with form,' said Van Gaal yesterday. 'For us Wayne is very important as a player, as a captain and because he can score goals. But he can do that from midfield, too. The last goal he scored \u2014 against Aston Villa \u2014 came when he was playing in midfield.' Van Gaal's mid-season deployment of Rooney in midfield remains a sensitive subject. No coach likes to admit he may have been wrong. All that matters now, though, is the 29-year-old's current trajectory, which is undoubtedly upwards. His name is written right through recent derby history of course. He is the fixture's record goalscorer and the scorer of one of its most spectacular goals, that remarkable overhead kick back in 2011 that some City supporters, rather oddly, still maintain came off his shin. Previously there had been the transfer saga of autumn 2010. Courted heavily by City as he prevaricated over a new United contract, Rooney most definitely had his head turned. To this day, rumours persist of meetings in an underground car park at the Etihad Stadium \u2014 that one has always seemed a little fanciful \u2014 and promises of a salary in excess of \u00a3300,000 per week. Rooney scores his side's second goal during United's 3-1 Premier League victory over Aston Villa . What we do know is that there was a point when City and their manager Roberto Mancini thought the transfer was about to happen. So, too, did many United fans. 'Join City and You're Dead' warned graffiti on a city-centre poster carrying his image at the time. Had it done so then these fixtures would probably never have been the same again. As it is, derby day now finds Rooney even more fired up and motivated than ever. City have won the last four and one only has to scroll through the tapes to watch the England centre forward's body language, especially during last season's 4-1 reverse at the Etihad, to see exactly how that has gone down. Rooney may be a Liverpudlian but he understands the City rivalry better than most at his club. In Stretford, Rooney has the opportunity to ease United clear of Manuel Pellegrini's team. When asked yesterday if he has a leader of the United captain's ilk in his squad the City manager was less than convincing. 'Every squad has different kinds of personalities, different players,' said Pellegrini. 'All of them have different options to motivate in different ways. 'I don't think it's good to analyse the personality of our captain. In a squad you must have not just one leader, not just the captain.' City captain Vincent Kompany has been struggling with a hamstring injury but is expected to play against United, albeit with discomfort. He has admitted Rooney's volley of 2011 stayed with him for some time and it's little wonder. It remains a stand-out memory of recent fixtures and Rooney now finds himself in the perfect position to contribute some more.

My gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me. We had a great relationship and I\u2019ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her.

She was 84. She was an incredible woman. \u2018She lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. She was always happy, making jokes and I had that sort of outlook on life. She always believed in me and gave me reassurances. It has been a difficult time.\u2019 His grandmother would have been proud of young Aaron as he took time out from preparations for today\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Reading to pay his tribute to her. Just as she must have been proud of his career in football and the way he rebuilt it after a badly broken leg. \u2018She used to watch me play and would take me to games when I was eight or nine,\u2019 Ramsey added. \u2018She would always be asking how I was doing. She didn\u2019t go to my games but I got her Sky to watch a few.

I was just running about and it all caught up on me then so I needed a couple of seconds just to get my breath back and realise just what I\u2019d just actually done. It was definitely overwhelming.

We are putting pressure on ourselves to get the best from each other and I feel we\u2019ve done that in the second half of this season. \u2018We\u2019ve really stuck by each other, worked hard for each other and we want another feeling like we had last season. We do push ourselves as a team and I think the title is getting closer. Last season we started really well and maybe faded away. We lost against the bigger teams, but this season we\u2019ve done better against them. This season, we didn\u2019t start too well but the second half has been really good and consistent. I feel we are very close.\u2019 If Chelsea collapse against the odds in the title race, Arsenal are best placed to pounce after a run of 33 points from a dozen Barclays Premier League games since New Year\u2019s Day. \u2018That\u2019s still a possibility,\u2019 said Ramsey. \u2018You can\u2019t rule it out. You can\u2019t. When you have that momentum, it is still possible. Even though it will be difficult we have to win our remaining games and see where that leaves us. \u2018It\u2019s going to be difficult.

But that does not mean they will swat Reading aside. \u2018We probably did feel the pressure,\u2019 admitted Ramsey. \u2018But we got through and went on to win it and we haven\u2019t got that sort of pressure now. That pressure is gone because we won something and there is no more of this \u201cnine years\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s a different sort of pressure, but one we\u2019ve been up against many times when we\u2019ve played lesser teams.

Rosberg accused Hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018So you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first.\u00a0If you have to save tyres, brakes, engine, gearbox whatever it is, that's what you do. 'You don't think about the guy behind you, what he is feeling, how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff. \u2018I have been in this situation with Michael [Schumacher] where where I was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way,\u2019 added Hakkinen. \u2018What Lewis and Nico are going through at the moment, they are having a very difficult challenge, already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them.

He wants to win but first he has to beat Lewis but Nico is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing. I don't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole.\u2019 Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn\u2019t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I\u2019m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It\u2019s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I\u2019m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to\u2026 it\u2019s not my job to look after Nico\u2019s race. My job\u2019s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible \u2013 and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is confident the matter has been laid to rest after Rosberg bemoaned Hamilton's 'selfish' tactics following their one-two finish at the Shanghai International Circuit. Hamilton was absolved of any blame by both Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, although the problem did at least provide another scenario from which to learn. Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday . Hamilton led home Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Shanghai to retain his lead in the championship . With the next race in Bahrain following up swiftly on Sunday, Wolff said: 'We saw tensions between Nico and Lewis in the race and we tackled them directly on Sunday night to stop anything carrying over to this weekend. 'When you have intense competition it's normal it causes emotions to run high - and that's not something we want to change. 'Both drivers are now very focused on delivering maximum performance in Bahrain and our package should cope well with the demands of the circuit. 'We maintain our philosophy of letting the drivers race, but they both know the No 1 priority for the team is to win for Mercedes-Benz.' For Rosberg, in particular, the race offers an opportunity for swift retribution as the 29-year-old has so far been trounced this season by Hamilton, who has finished ahead on the grid after qualifying and in all three races to date. Hamilton, who has out-qualified and finished ahead of Rosberg at every race, sprays a grid girl with champagne . 'China was a frustrating weekend for me and I'm glad we have another race right away to get straight back to work,' said Rosberg.

Last year's intense battle between Hamilton and Rosberg was one of the highlights of the season, and lit the blue touchpaper to their rivalry as it was later discovered the latter attacked Hamilton by using a different engine setting.

{"input": "Lewis Hamilton insists he is ready for Nico Rosberg's tactics should his Mercedes team-mate attempt anything underhand in the wake of his latest outburst. Rosberg's criticism of Hamilton following Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix has reopened old wounds that at times festered between the duo last year.

Lewis Hamilton (right) insists he is prepared for further criticism from Mercede's team-mate Nico Rosberg . Hamilton beat his Mercedes colleague to win the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday . Mercedes top brass Toto Wolff and Niki Lauda insist Hamilton was not at fault, with the eventual one-two the best result for the team. With Rosberg distinctly second best to Hamilton so far this season - as he has been out-qualified and out-raced by the Briton in all three grands prix - it remains to be seen what tricks he might have up his sleeve to stop the rot and regain the advantage. In Monaco last year it has been suggested by many Rosberg deliberately thwarted Hamilton during qualifying, earning pole and following up with the race win. In Belgium, Rosberg earned a rebuke and had sanctions imposed on him by the team after colliding with Hamilton on only the second lap which forced the latter out of the race. Hamilton (right) led Rosberg at the Chinese Grand Prix, and later came under criticism from his team-mate . The British racer, who leads the Drivers' Championship by 13 points, sprays champagne on a hostess . Although aware Rosberg may do all he can to beat him, an unperturbed Hamilton said: 'I feel pretty well prepared, having experienced all those kind of things. 'That stuff doesn't cross my mind. I think we're professional. We've been through some ups and downs and now we're in a good place. 'And anyway, I would like to think I am stronger this year and that will be reflected moving forwards.' The bottom line is at present Rosberg does not have an answer for Hamilton's form and pace as the 30-year-old has won eight of the last 10 races. Hamilton has also suggested Rosberg should seize a chance when it is presented to him, as was the case in Shanghai. Hamilton claimed after the race that Rosberg (left) was not quick enough to catch him even if he tried . The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai finished with a Mercedes one-two, and Sebastian Vettel third for Ferrari . 'You have to try and sympathise with people's opinions,' said Hamilton. 'I always try, in all walks of life, to put myself in that position because you wouldn't want that to happen to you. You try to think that. 'But I said to the guys, if I was in second and I had the pace I had, I would have been pushing to be as close as possible and passing. That's racing. Nico didn't try. 'They said maybe he was just comfortable second, and I said \"Well, that's the difference between us. I want to win always\". 'I would have done everything to get past, or at least pushed for three laps if I could.' Hamilton drives during the Formula One Grand Prix race at the Shanghai International Circuit on April 12 . But then cuttingly, Hamilton added: 'Even if he had (pushed), and he had got relatively close, he just wasn't quick enough. 'If you take a step back, this is motor racing, man. Racing. Don't take away the fun of the racing. It's racing. 'If I was in second or third, I would have done everything. I wouldn't have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint.

It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third.

All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying.

Jockey Aidan Coleman (left) exits the weighing room at Haydock racecourse back in April earlier this year . The Druids Nephew ridden by Barry Geraghty clears the last jump during Day One of Cheltenham 2015 . As a 20-year-old, Coleman chose to ride seventh fence faller Stan, a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful Venetia Williams-trained stablemate Mon Mome who lifted the prize at 100-1 with stand-in rider Liam Treadwell basking in glory. It was the only time in three National runs for Mon Mome that Coleman had not ridden the gelding. Coleman's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered The Rainbow Hunter. Coleman said: 'The Mom Mome incident was quite a blow at the time because I had a choice (of mounts) and picked the wrong one. I rode him the year before and the year afterwards, I just wasn't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes. 'Sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind \u2013 that is life in general. 'At the time I was 20, very young in life as well as racing.

Since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days, so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned. 'I didn't had the best of luck on The Rainbow Hunter. He jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year. 'There is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the National because of the nature of the fences and the distance.' Coleman, who has enjoyed success over the famous fences in other races, feels The Druids Nephew has the right credential given that slice of Aintree luck which has so far eluded him.

This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte\u2019s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It\u2019s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it\u2019s laid through the hen\u2019s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey.

In a tweet, the Scotland and Edinburgh centre said: \u2018Gutted that my season is over already after getting surgery. \u2018Brings an end to a frustrating year for me but positive about next few months.\u2019 Edinburgh are short of cover in the centre positions and will now rely on New Zealander Phil Burleigh and South African Andries Strauss \u2014 who both started in the quarter-final away win over London Irish in the absence of Scott \u2014 from now until the end of the season. Scott went under the knife last week but he has now been told he will have to be operated on again . Kiwi Sam Beard is the only other experienced centre at the club. To add to their woes, Edinburgh also have a major doubt over David Denton, who was forced off with a head knock in the 34-3 Pro12 loss to Munster on Saturday. Denton is following return-to-play protocols and a late decision on the back-row forward\u2019s fitness will be taken. Without Scott and possibly Denton, Edinburgh will be less confident of overcoming the Dragons on Friday and reaching the Challenge Cup Final, where they would play Gloucester or Exeter. Like Edinburgh, the Dragons may be in the lower half of the table, but they are in a rich vein of form and have won three matches in a row. Their latest and biggest scalp was taken last weekend when they overcame Leinster 25-22 in the Pro12. Hooker Ross Ford is desperate to defeat the Welsh and keep alive his dream of being part of the first Scottish professional club side to lift silverware. The Scotland international has managed just 14 games for club and country in the past year . Ford is one of seven survivors from the Edinburgh team that lost 22-19 in the Heineken Cup semi-final against Ulster three years ago. But the hooker insists reaching the European Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stoop on May 1 would overtake even that 2012 highlight. \u2018I have been at Edinburgh through many ups and downs, so to win the Challenge Cup would be my biggest achievement,\u2019 said 85-times-capped Ford. \u2018It would also be a massive boost and something the club could take confidence from and build on in future seasons. It wouldn\u2019t just be good for us, but also for Scottish rugby. \u2018We didn\u2019t have a good Six Nations in terms of results and it would be a great boost to the game in Scotland if we manage to get to the final and win it.\u2019 Ford insists Edinburgh have already forgotten that embarrassing home defeat to Munster and believes confidence remains high ahead of Friday\u2019s match. \u2018This is a European Challenge Cup semi-final and we will all be up for it,\u2019 said the 30-year-old former Scotland captain. \u2018We weren\u2019t at our best against Munster but we will be fixing what went wrong in training this week. \u2018What we have in our favour is home advantage and we can expect a big crowd who will give is us a lot of backing. \u2018I have detected an excitement among our fans about the European game and our whole Challenge Cup campaign.\u2019", "answer": "Centre Matt Scott will miss the rest of the season because of injury .\nScotland international needs more surgery on problematic shoulder .\nScott went under the knife last week but has been told he needs more .\nThe 24-year-old has played just 14 games for club and country in past year .", "completion": ["Scotland international centre Matt Scott has been ruled out for the rest of the season due to a shoulder operation, casting doubt on his participation in September's World Cup and dealing a blow to Edinburgh's European Challenge Cup hopes."]}

{"input": "Ryan Bertrand believes he deserves to be higher up the England pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager Roy Hodgson. The 25-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Southampton, where the left-back moved permanently earlier in the year having impressed on loan from Chelsea. Bertrand has attracted plenty of plaudits for his displays at St Mary's, yet struggled to gain the international recognition many of his colleagues have received. Ryan Bertrand was the fifth left back to be called in to Roy Hodgson's England squad last month . A call-up had been predicted for England's internationals against Lithuania and Italy last month, yet Hodgson plumped for Leighton Baines, Kieran Gibbs and Luke Shaw. Danny Rose was then preferred when Shaw pulled out, only for Bertrand to get the nod once the Tottenham full-back and then Baines dropped out. It meant the Saints left-back travelled to Italy and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1-1 draw in Turin, with his third England cap a peculiar end to the international break. 'It was different,' he said, smiling. 'The international break changed from one extreme to the next, but it was good to get back in the frame and get back in the door. 'It was good to get on the pitch, even though it was very brief. 'When you actually sit there, it hits you that all them years you spent as a kid watching football games, the England games were always the biggest. Bertrand slides in to challenge Everton midfielder James McCarthy earlier this month . 'To finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything, knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic.' England are, in fairness, blessed with strength impressive depth at left-back, with West Ham's Aaron Cresswell another arguably worthy of a call-up. Bertrand appreciates that breadth of options, but hopes to prove to Hodgson that he deserves to be further up the pecking order. 'You know, it's down to (the manager),' he said. 'Whoever he wants to pick, it is his decision. 'I'll just concentrate on my game. I'm confident enough to know that I should be in there, but I don't pick the team so I'll just keep playing.' Bertrand was one of three Southampton players in action that night in Turin, with Nathaniel Clyne starting at right-back for England and Graziano Pelle leading the line for Italy. Bertrand made his move to Southampton from Chelsea permanent in January after impressing on loan . The 29-year-old striker showed no ill-effects of the scoring drought at club level, glancing the Azzurri ahead at the Juventus Stadium - a goal the striker followed up with a first Premier League strike since December 20 in Saturday's 2-0 defeat of Hull. 'I was just thinking it is typical - anyone, anyone but him,' Bertrand said, laughing. 'It was good for him to get a goal. 'The fans have been very supportive, I think.

{"input": "A Labour government would take action to enforce a Premier League commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport, the party has said. Shadow health secretary and keen football fan Andy Burnham said the move could unlock \u00a3400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament. And he said Labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects. Andy Burnham (left) and Ed Miliband promise that Labour will make the Premier League invest in grassroots . Mr Burnham accused Prime Minister David Cameron of failing to get tough on the Premier League despite a massive increase in its TV revenues during his time in power. Although the league puts \u00a3168million into grassroots sport, this represents only a fraction of the \u00a35billion it has taken in from TV deals between 2013 and 2016, said Labour. Mr Burnham said: 'The last Labour government secured a commitment from the Premier League that five per cent of all TV income should be invested in the grassroots. 'Since then, TV rights have soared by over 160 per cent, but David Cameron has failed to make sure that the game's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through. David Cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the Premier League . 'Football at grassroots is struggling and, in many cities, Premier League stadia loom over run-down changing rooms and overgrown pitches. The gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider. 'Premier League clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest. That is why a Labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the Premier League owes is paid in full, unlocking an estimated \u00a3400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament.' Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford added: 'We will get tough and under Labour's better plan we will make sure the Premier League lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots. This will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports.' BT Sport and Sky Sports were part of the lucrative TV deal estimated around \u00a35billion starting in 2016 . A Premier League spokesman said: 'The success of the Premier League benefits the development of the English game outside of the top flight. Significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards, and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005. 'Only last month Premier League clubs committed to investing at least \u00a31bn outside of the league from 2016-2019. That will mean even more investment in grass-roots football.

{"input": "Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my uneducated eyes can see, someone like West Ham would be the best place for your money, if you're that way inclined. A sudden influx of largely Spanish-based signings would bring (mostly temporary) excitement and they'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the Big Sam years at least. That's where Rafa excels; Europa League success at Stamford Bridge and triumph in the Coppa Italia last term are further testament to this. But a threat to us and where we want to be? It would only be a result of our own self-destruction. Good luck, Rafa. And thanks for the memories.", "answer": "Rafa Benitez won the Champions League and FA Cup with Liverpool .\nBut the Spaniard is little more than a cup manager, lacking league titles .\nLiverpool fans are grateful to Benitez for his successes .\nBut the Kop faithful won't mind him coming back to England with new club .", "completion": ["Rafa Benitez, despite managing some of Europe's most established clubs, has not won any league titles, but has proven to be an excellent cup manager, most recently leading his Napoli side to a victory over Europa League favourites Wolfsburg."]}

Midfielder Juninho (right) is widely considered to be one of Middlesbrough's greatest-ever players, and starred in Gibson's foray into computerised football management during his teenage years . Steve Gibson helped save the Teessiders from liquidation in 1986 and eight years later took control, his investment seeing them win the Carling Cup in 2004 and reach the final of the UEFA Cup in 2006. But six consecutive seasons outside of the Premier League has proved a financial strain. That is why Gibson readily labels the televised clash at Norwich City \u2013 one point above them and second in the Championship - as the biggest match in the club's history. 'The way the Premier League is and the gap financially makes this our biggest game ever,' said the centre-back. 'If we get back in the Premier League it's different to the last time we were there. It has more of an impact, financially, than what the cup finals did. 'It's \u00a3100m for going up, that is irreplaceable. It will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the Carling Cup.' Nunthorpe-born Gibson is a lifelong Boro fan. He was there when they beat Bolton at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to lift the first trophy in the club's history and again in Eindhoven two years later when Sevilla ran out 4-0 winners. He eclipsed all of that, however, in his bedroom at home. 'I was always Middlesbrough boss on Football Manager \u2013 and I was pretty good,' he recalled.

Sevilla's\u00a0Adriano Correia (left) shoots during the 2006 UEFA Cup final, in which his side beat Boro 4-0 . 'My uncle always gave me loads to spend! The best I got was the group stage of the Champions League. We got knocked out without making the second round and he gave me the bullet! 'But in the real world I leave all that business to him. And if we do go up then I'll be hoping that he keeps hold of me!' There is no danger of that not happening. Gibson has been a rock at the heart of the division's best defence \u2013 they have conceded 10 fewer than any rival \u2013 and will be part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for this summer's Euros in the Czech Republic. Perhaps, then, promotion and an impressive showing for his country will silence all accusations of nepotism. 'I don't mind people saying that I'm only here because of my uncle, it motivates me,' he said. 'You would think playing for England kills that talk anyway \u2013 because I don't think my uncle picks the England squad. 'But I'm used to it. I've had it all my life and it drives me on.' Were Gibson ever to let up, then his Boro-supporting pals would be onto him long before his uncle. They are even more anxious than he is as the tightest promotion race in Championship history nears its conclusion. 'My mates are stressing out more than me,' said Gibson. 'It's better for me because it's in my hands. After every game I come in and it' s like heart-attack material in our whatsapp group \u2013 it's incredible. 'But they believe in us and that's massive. They feel we deserve that promotion. 'And I think my uncle deserves it too. He's been amazing. His loyalty and what he has put in deserves reward with promotion back to the Premier League.' Given the ambition of his uncle, perhaps then Ben can aim to right the wrongs of his previous adventure in the Champions League.

The midfielder scored a spectacular strike as former Palace boss Tony Pulis enjoyed a 2-0 win on his first return to Selhurst Park.

West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side . But Gardner, whose trademark second-half goal added to James Morrison's early header, knows the job is still not yet complete even if West Brom now sit eight points clear of the bottom three. 'Yes, it's massive,' he said when asked about the importance of the victory. 'The gaffer has given us the target of 40 points and we will be disappointed if we don't hit that. 'We had two or three bad results on the spin and it's nice to get a win over the line after those. We were expecting what they brought with us and we dealt really well with it.' Gardner revealed the set-piece which led to Morrison heading home in the second minute came straight from the training ground as he now looks to add to his own tally for the season. 'It was a start that we worked on all week in training and it has worked perfectly,' he added. Gardner lets fly with this long range strike, which ended up doubling West Brom's lead at the Selhurst Park . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner . On the goal he scored, Gardner added: 'It was nice to catch one like that, over the years I've caught a couple of sweet ones and I usually get a couple in a season so I'm waiting for another one now.' For Palace, their fine run of form may have come to an abrupt end but Scott Dann, who was signed by Pulis in January 2014, insists the squad will dust themselves down and look to go again at home to relegation-threatened Hull next weekend.

DALEY BLIND 6 \u2013 Got forward well and was involved in two of United\u2019s three goals but looked susceptible to the pace of Navas on defence . MICHAEL CARRICK 7 \u2013 His calming influence in midfield was so important for United again, and also produced several timely interceptions. Marouane Fellaini helps Manchester United take the lead at Old Trafford as Joe Hart looks on in anguish . JUAN MATA 7.5 \u2013 Two goals against Liverpool and now one against City, Mata finally looks as though he is settled as a United player and deserved his standing ovation.

{"input": "Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits he would not be able to ease striker Romelu Lukaku through the remainder of the season even if he wanted to. The Belgium international is set to return from a four-week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend at home to Burnley. Considering the workload the 21-year-old has had over the last 10 months, taking in the World Cup in Brazil and then heading straight into a Premier League and European campaign, there may have been a temptation to let their top scorer have a more restful end to the season with the Toffees having nothing to play for. Roberto Martinez admits he would not be able to ease Romelu Lukaku (pictured) back in even if he wanted to . Everton striker Lukaku is set to return from a four-week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend . However, Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince him to take it easy, even if he was inclined to protect his striker from more injuries before the end of the campaign. 'I think it would be near-enough impossible to keep Rom away from the football pitch at this stage. It's not in his nature,' said the Spaniard. 'Someone like Rom needs to be on the football pitch. He is only 21 and I don't think there is any need for that at all. 'If I am completely honest I think he has been suffering a lot in the last seven to 10 days that he has been injured and away from the team. 'Rom belongs on the pitch, working for the team and scoring goals and becoming important and I don't think there is a strong case to rest him now. 'What we have to make sure is when he gets involved with Belgium in June he gets a proper break and he can recover and regenerate and get ready for next season.' Lukaku struggled to find his form in the first half of the season after the World Cup and he had only two goals to his name by mid-October. In 26 appearances up to and including January 1 he scored just seven times, but Martinez believes once he regained full sharpness there was a significant change. That is backed up by his statistics since January 1 as he has scored 11 in 16 matches. Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince striker Lukaku to take it easy . Everton manager Martinez pictured at the Liberty Stadium where his side drew 1-1 with Swansea City . 'I think there have been two clear different periods,' added Martinez. 'Coming back from the World Cup was a really tough moment from a physical point of view to get back to his best level. 'We worked really hard to get him back to the level and from the last week of December there was a real change for someone like him who relies on his physical capability. 'I thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different Romelu: someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective. 'He has always been a clinical goalscorer and I think his level has generally been quite impressive.' In four Europa League ties in the knockout stage Lukaku scored seven times, including a hat-trick against Young Boys in Switzerland. With 18 goals in total this season he is Everton's leading scorer by some considerable margin (Steven Naismith and Kevin Mirallas have nine apiece).

'He is only 21 and it is only his second full season in an important role in a team playing a lot of minutes. 'Last season he managed to play 20 full games, I expect him to play more than that this season and that will be an incredible step forward to grow and develop.

{"input": "Andrew Flintoff fears Kevin Pietersen is 'running out of time' to resurrect his England career. Flintoff, speaking at the England and Wales Cricket Board's NatWest T20 launch, sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for 'probably the premier tournament' in this country. The dual Ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced, however, about Pietersen's prospects of forcing his way back into Test contention. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad . Former England star Andrew Flintoff thiks time is running out for Pietersen to resurrect his England career . Pietersen already has three Ashes series wins on his CV but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins, and Flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side. The controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after Alastair Cook's team were whitewashed 5-0 in Australia, but has taken heart from incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves' hints that there may be a way back after all. Pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the 'clean slate' being presented to him, and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against MCCU Oxford in his first red-ball innings for Surrey since June 2013. Flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for Pietersen. 'He's a fantastic player, but nobody just walks into any team - especially the England team, 'I'm back, I'm here, I'm playing',' Flintoff told Press Association Sport. England have won their last three Tests under Cook, pre-dating a miserable World Cup, and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the West Indies. Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . It is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside, on current form. 'Which of them do you say \"you're not playing!\" for Kevin to come in?' Flintoff said. 'I just think Kevin is running out of time a little bit. 'If he'd started the season last year with Surrey, and scored run after run and put himself in the position... whereas now I think he's looking at the Ashes and he's just running out of time. 'That's not to say he (definitely) won't feature, but I can't imagine it's going to be in the near future.' Flintoff is optimistic about England's fortunes, despite their winter woes, with or without Pietersen. 'Alastair Cook is so important, and you get the sense everyone within the England set-up wants him as captain,' he said. 'He's a popular lad, and a great player. 'Peter Moores, there aren't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke.' The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket . England, Flintoff believes, just need a little more support. 'I think sometimes as a pundit, ex-player, you forget how difficult it can be,' he added. 'In Australia, you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants Australia to do well. 'With England, I've never had a sense of that. 'It's about time we started talking them up. I think it's time we started supporting the side, getting behind Cook, Moores, the players. 'It's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who hasn't moved his feet. (I think) maybe we should be a bit better than that, and start celebrating the lads a bit.' He is enthusiastic too about this summer's T20 Blast, insisting it is no poor relation of the Indian Premier League - or the Big Bash, in which he played last winter for Brisbane Heat. Flintoff says Alastair Cook is so important to England despite poor showing in the first Test against West indies . Flintoff said: 'The competition gets stronger. It's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now, with the crowds and excitement behind it. 'We're seeing that, with some of the players coming over - the world's best, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, (Glenn) Maxwell, (Aaron) Finch. 'I played in the Big Bash, and the standard was high (but) this stands up as a competition. 'You turn up at Old Trafford for Lancashire-Yorkshire, and get 25,000 people, then to Chelmsford where they're playing in front of packed houses - so I don't subscribe to that. 'Anything in this country, we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there. 'We don't really focus on what we've got. Flintoff shares a joke with players at the Natwest T20 Blast launch at Edgbaston on Thursday . 'I didn't see anything within the Big Bash and thought 'this is far better than what we've got at home'.' Whether at 37 he will be a part of the Blast again, after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping Lancashire to win the tournament last summer, is another matter. 'I'm not arrogant enough to think I can just walk into the Lancashire dressing-room and say 'I'm back, I'm playing',' he added. 'The one reason I wanted to play (last year) is because I love it and I never want to look back at my life, when I'm older, and think 'I wish I'd done that'. 'I don't see failing as a problem. But I see not having a go as a crime.

{"input": "As Jimmy Anderson prepares to play his 100th Test - needing only three wickets to equal Ian Botham\u2019s England-record haul of 383 - Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth spoke to those who knew him and played with him in his early days for Burnley, Lancashire and England. England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . MICHAEL BROWN . Burnley CC team-mate, now club chairman . We used to call Jimmy the \u2018Pro Killer\u2019. Playing in the Lancashire League, he\u2019d regularly get the opposition professional out. He was quite a slight kid. It was probably when he was 17 that we thought, wow, he\u2019s got some pace. And he had this ability to bowl jaffas. When he bowled so brilliantly against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup everyone at Burnley was saying: \u2018We\u2019ve seen these magic balls before.\u2019 Anderson was known as Pro Killer during his days with Burnley, reveals former team-mate and now club chairman Michael Brown . My mum can take some of the credit for Jimmy being signed by Lancashire. He was bowling really well for Burnley, and she rang up John Stanworth, who was at the club at the time. Jimmy was invited for trials by Lancashire and that was that. He was always a shy lad. But he cares very much. JOHN STANWORTH . Former Lancashire player development manager . His potential was brought to my attention by Val Brown so I\u2019m not going to take credit for unearthing Jimmy. I didn\u2019t necessarily think he\u2019d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him. When he arrived for Under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace. But it was the late swing that stood out. Even established batsmen struggled to line him up. They were playing and missing all the time. He made them look ordinary. In the early days I just left him alone. He had these unusual mannerisms, like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery, and a strange rotation of the shoulders. But I ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out. I just said: \u2018We\u2019ve got a 17-year-old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out!\u2019 WARREN HEGG . Anderson\u2019s first captain at Lancashire and wicketkeeper . He burst on to the scene in my first year as captain. There was talk of this kid from the valleys in Lancashire. He wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action. He bowled to me in a centre net practice at Old Trafford and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin. I thought: \u2018Either I\u2019m losing it or this kid\u2019s special\u2019. And he really was. We sat down with coach Mike Watkinson and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball. So we\u2019d have three slips, a gully and a deep point. It gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler. He went from strength to strength. Anderson (back row second from left) 'wouldn\u2019t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light,' says his 2002 Lancashire captain Warren Hegg (front row fifth from left) He was a keeper\u2019s dream. He was in the high-80s and took the ball away so I always thought I was going to get a nick. That said, he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early. He bowled James Middlebrook down at Chelmsford and I dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails. But I could console myself with the thought that I\u2019d kept to England\u2019s best. MIKE WATKINSON . Anderson\u2019s first coach at Lancashire . I was coaching the Lancashire second team when Jimmy arrived. He had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent. Some would swing, others wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and I did some work with him before one game at Middleton. I tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips. He related to it straight away. Since then, he\u2019s worked things out for himself. Jimmy\u2019s been his own best coach. IAN WARD . Anderson\u2019s first first-class victim: Lancashire v Surrey, Old Trafford, May 31, 2002 . He was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet. His run-up was the same. I just remember him being quality. He had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first. To me, a left-hander, it was an awayswinger. I remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to Warren Hegg. Sky Sports commentator Ian Ward (left with Shane Warne) was Jimmy's first first-class victim . I thought \u2018Christ, this guy can bowl!\u2019 In those days Lancashire had Peter Martin and Glen Chapple and we weren\u2019t expecting them to go on forever. We thought, they\u2019ve found another one already. That was the talk in the Surrey dressing-room. And when he got Ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different. MARK RAMPRAKASH . Dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match . I faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump. But they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper\u2019s gloves quite hard. He was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick. Mark Ramprakash, now England batting coach, was dismissed LBW with the first ball of the second innings . In the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball. It was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front. I was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing, or maybe reverse. It was a terrific delivery. You tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away. It raised a few eyebrows. At the Old Trafford Test against India last summer I was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and I couldn\u2019t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling. To witness that live was amazing. NASSER HUSSAIN . Anderson\u2019s first England captain, in 2002-03 . He came into the team after yet another Ashes disaster. He was a breath of fresh air, a natural talent - very un-English! He wasn\u2019t over-coached or too technical. He just ran in and bowled swing. He was the kind of player you might get from Pakistan. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup . For such a young lad, he wasn\u2019t someone you needed to over-manage or look after. He was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. If anything I probably had such a good impression of him that I gave him more responsibility than I should have done - like bowling him instead of Andrew Caddick at the end of our World Cup game against Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003. He got hit for six and I apologised to him later. He was playing pool, shrugged his shoulders, and got on with his game. But I knew he was going to be one of our greats. It\u2019s one thing being a swing bowler but it\u2019s the way he could get it to go so late. I faced him just once and he got me first ball at Old Trafford as part of a hat-trick. He\u2019s a very clever cricketer. MARK BUTCHER . Man of the match on Anderson\u2019s Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord\u2019s in 2003 . Anderson celebrates the wicket of Zimbabwe's Travis Friend with Michael Vaughan (right) and Robert Key (left) during his debut Test at Lord's in May 2003, in which Mark Butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match . Like Jimmy, I took five wickets in that game. I like to think I taught him everything he knows about swing bowling. This was the first time I\u2019d seen him close up. He swung it both ways and at serious pace. I thought, we\u2019ve found one here. I took a catch off him. Andy Bignaut was trying to work one through square-leg but he nicked it to slip. It was a cracking delivery. It\u2019s an easy thing to do when you\u2019re new to get your bouncer through quickly, then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length. But his full balls were coming out at a good pace too. He was brilliant.", "answer": "James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua starting Monday .\nThe quick needs four scalps to become England top Test wicket taker .\nHe was called 'Pro Killer' as a teen knocking over batsmen for Burnley .\nMark Butcher recalls Jimmy's Test debut at Lord\u2019s back in 2003 .", "completion": ["As Jimmy Anderson prepares for his 100th Test, needing only three wickets to equal Ian Botham\u2019s England-record haul of 383, Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth spoke to those who knew him and played with him in his early days for Burnley, Lancashire and England."]}

This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend\u00a0Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at Clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.'

Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with blonde . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.

Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. The 73rd minute substitute for the Lancashire non-league side was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside, on Saturday afternoon, was shared on social media. His team had just suffered a\u00a04-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage.\u00a0Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within\u00a0hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.'

'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it.

{"input": "Manchester City Under 18s boss Jason Wilcox, whose side take on Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final on Monday, is aiming to emulate United's famous Class of '92. Wilcox, himself let go by his current employers as a teenager, could field a starting XI of players all born in Greater Manchester for the clash against the favoured opponents from west London. And, while it may be unlikely anyone will emulate a golden generation across town that yielded the likes of the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, the ex-Blackburn winger believes that is the target. Manchester City Under 18s manager Jason Wilcox wants to deliver local players to the first team . Wilcox talks with Manchester City elite development squad coach Patrick Vieira . 'It could happen again but they were freak years,' Wilcox said. 'You look at United as a one-off, Barcelona the same. 'Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge.' The first leg will take place under lights at the impressive, newly-opened 7,200-capacity stadium within the grounds of the \u00a3200m Etihad Campus, a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within. Wilcox believes those facilities, coupled with elite coaching, stand City in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent. Wilcox hopes to emulate Manchester United's 'Class of 92' but says it will be very difficult . 'We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea,' he said. 'It's up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I'm convinced once they see us it's very difficult to walk away from.' Will the final, between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players, be a chance to stick two fingers up to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, who a year ago described the lack of English talent at Manchester City as 'pretty depressing'? Wilcox does not want to get into that. 'There\u2019s a lot of media attention from Greg Dyke with regards to increasing the home-grown quota,' he said. Wilcox believes City's new Etihad campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters . A look inside one of the gyms at Manchester City's training complex . 'We can\u2019t get embroiled in that because, for us, it\u2019s a day-to-day question of how do we improve players? 'Proposals have already been put forward with regards to home-grown quotas. If he (Dyke) wants to increase it, then that is up to him. But whether you increase or lower the numbers, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you have to be good enough to get through.' Wilcox knows all about being good enough to get through at a club where money is no object. The Bolton youngster, who joined Blackburn at 14, was the only youth product to regularly appear in their Jack Walker-fuelled Premier League triumph in 1995. 'When I was a young player at Blackburn Jack Walker came in and brought Kenny (Dalglish),' he said. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . 'You go two ways. Do I go elsewhere and take my chances or have I got stomach for fight and see what happens? Luckily for me I was the only homegrown player which was a great privilege. Now I'm passing my experience to younger ones.' Wilcox's arrival at Ewood Park came after rejection at none other than City. He remembers it well. 'I\u2019d joined City at 13 and got released at 14,' he recalled. 'It\u2019s quite fitting really because when I\u2019m speaking to younger players I can always recall that chat if you like. I think at that time it was a case of I just got told that they were not going to retain me on a year\u2019s contract. 'It was devastating at the time. Everything was going really well. But to be told that it is tough for a young kid. But I just recall my own experience whenever I have to tell the lads and have the younger age groups. You have to go through some period in your life like that where not everything is going to go fantastically well.' Wilcox was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for Blackburn during title-winning season . City manager Manuel Pellegrini will be at the Etihad Campus, as will England Under 21s chief Gareth Southgate. Things have not gone according to plan for the Chilean's first team this season, but does Wilcox believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club's only silverware this season? 'Not really,' he said. 'At the start of the year, irrespective of what was happening at first-team level, the FA Youth Cup was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and I think it\u2019s great that they are being put under a bit of pressure.'

The 21-year-old, who was second last year, moved from fourth in the world rankings to second behind Rory McIlroy as a result and that means the world's top two players have a combined age of 46.

{"input": "Southampton manager Ronald Koeman accepts it will be difficult to keep hold of Nathaniel Clyne this summer as Manchester United prepare a bid for England's first-choice right back. An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'", "answer": "Southampton have seen several of their best players leave in recent years .\nNathaniel Clyne looks set to be the next to move on from St Mary's .\nManchester United have been linked with a move for the right back .\nSaints boss Ronald Koeman admits it will be difficult to keep him .", "completion": ["Southampton manager Ronald Koeman acknowledges the difficulty in retaining Nathaniel Clyne as Manchester United prepares a bid for the right back."]}

Massimo Cellino insists he had nothing to do with the events that led to players pulling out of Saturday's match against Charlton . Mirco Antenucci was among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton .

'I only found out on Friday evening. I admit it looks weird. But if the players were injured, why didn't the manager inform the chairman? 'This looks like a fight between manager Neil Redfearn and the ownership of the club, which is not good.' Cellino's ban and the injury controversy are just two of a string of chaotic events that have plagued Leeds recently with Redfearn's position increasingly threatened over recent weeks . Giuseppe Bellusci, Antenucci and two other Italians were among those who made themselves unavailable . Redfearn has led the club to safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic, but he saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. The state of flux at Elland Road has led many fans to call for Cellino to leave the club altogether but the Italian insists he still wishes to take the Whites forward. 'From day one I felt I was at the right club, because I am more f****d up than the fans,' he said. 'I am 58 and my dream is still for us to do something big here.

Beating the club who ruthlessly relieved him of his duties last summer, on their home patch, as his side took a giant step towards Premier League survival \u2014 it does not get much better than that.

Sherwood went back for more, striding on to the pitch he called home last season for another double-fisted celebration as Villa supporters cheered wildly. All this without his trademark body-warmer on a mild day in north London. \u2018This is my most satisfying victory as a manager, because it\u2019s at such an important stage of the season and no-one gave us a chance,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018This week I\u2019ve had so many people tell me, \u201cYou can\u2019t win at White Hart Lane, Villa never win there\u201d. \u2018I\u2019ve been in the pressure of a title race as a player, but this is worse. When you\u2019re a player you only think about yourself. As a manager you\u2019ve got the expectations of the whole club \u2014 and this isn\u2019t a little club, it\u2019s massive.\u2019 Villa manager Sherwood was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle .

Villa midfielder Carlos Sanchez was sent off for committing a second bookable offence in the final exchanges against Tottenham . As for Tottenham, they can kiss the idea of Champions League football goodbye after this lacklustre defeat. This display suggests they do not deserve a top-four finish. Federico Fazio, alongside Eric Dier in central defence, was handed the unenviable task of taming Christian Benteke after Jan Vertonghen missed out through illness. The Belgian striker\u2019s run of seven goals in five games had given Villa\u2019s survival hopes a shot in the arm. By the final whistle Fazio was probably wishing Vertonghen had taken a shot of something to cure his illness as the brilliant Benteke fired Villa to victory. Spurs carved out the first clear-cut chance in the 27th minute, Brad Guzan saving well after Harry Kane had played in Danny Rose down the left. That was as good as it got for Tottenham, though, as Benteke\u2019s influence grew. Crowd reaction . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, and gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Touchline behaviour . The spring weather allowed to him leave his gilet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle. Told someone on the Spurs bench to \u2018shut the f*** up\u2019 as tempers flared in stoppage time. Tactics . Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second-half Spurs fightback, although it never seemed to come. Verdict . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points. Looks a different, more relaxed man, although he showed a glimpse of the old Tim at the final whistle.

Gabriel Agbonlahor should have been allowed to go one on one with Michel Vorm as he sprung Tottenham\u2019s offside trap, but he was wrongly flagged in the 31st minute. The decision sparked the first animated complaint from Sherwood, who had been unusually subdued to that point. Four minutes later, Sherwood was back on his feet. Not in anger this time, but in delight. If Villa preserve their top-flight status they will owe it to Benteke. They will also have Spurs defender Vlad Chiriches \u2014 filling in at right back for the injured Kyle Walker \u2014 to thank. The Romanian, who has been a peripheral figure for Pochettino, was having an uncomfortable afternoon, and the home fans were letting him know it, too. Chiriches\u2019s carelessness led to Villa\u2019s winner. After he sloppily conceded possession around 10 yards outside his area, the ball eventually fell to Bacuna, from whose cross Benteke out-jumped Fazio and directed his header past Vorm. Villa deserved their lead; without being easy on the eye, there was an intensity to their game that Tottenham could not handle. And in first-half stoppage time they very nearly doubled their advantage. Not for the first time, a long pass found Benteke, whose header released Agbonlahor, who cut inside Dier before watching his low drive from the edge of the area hit the post. Any faint hopes Pochettino still harboured of a top-four finish were fading fast. Tottenham did step up the tempo in the second half; Rose and Kane both went close with speculative efforts. But if Benteke was Villa\u2019s first-half hero, their central-defensive partnership of Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker took the honours after the break as Sherwood\u2019s men soaked up the pressure.

But it was Villa who missed two glorious chances to wrap up victory, Vlaar and Fabian Delph spurning gilt-edged opportunities in the closing stages. To add to Sherwood\u2019s anxiety, Villa had to play the final few minutes with 10 men after Carlos Sanchez picked up a second yellow card for a late challenge on Rose.

{"input": "As the World cup draws closer, it is not just in the rugby heartlands that they are beginning to feel the excitement. Twickenham, as the home of rugby, may be gearing up to embrace the sport\u2019s biggest tournament, but on the other side of the capital, the Olympic stadium \u2013 built for athletics and destined to be a football ground - is also quietly preparing to get in the oval-ball act. In Newcastle, St James\u2019 Park, usually a footballing stronghold, is another ground about to host Rugby\u2019s premier competition, and as former Bath, Saracens and England prop David \u2018Flats\u2019 Flatman has been finding out, from the north east to east London, England is getting rugby-fever. David 'Flats' Flatman has been driving around the Rugby World Cup venues preparing for the tournament . London's Olympic stadium may not be a traditional rugby ground, but the buzz around the game is palpable . \u2018Going to all these places and seeing the buzz around the World Cup already, is great,\u2019 says Flats on the drive between Stratford and Twickenham, as he tours around the country visiting the stadiums that will host matches come this autumn as part of BT Sport's Tour de Flats. \u2018You kind of expect that kind of a buzz in rugby cities, like Cardiff and Exeter. But when you arrive in Newcastle and the guy who is fixing the cabinet comes over to you to talk about rugby, you realise there\u2019s a proper enthusiasm in places that are normally dominated by football.\u2019 Building that enthusiasm, with the prospect of high-calibre sport on the horizon, is one thing. But as everyone connected with the Olympic stadium knows, maintaining it after the competition is gone is another matter altogether. But Flats is confident that, long term, this World Cup is going to have a lasting effect. \u2018There are bound to be studies that come out, or bits of research, 15 minutes after the final whistle of the World Cup final, and say there are only seven more children in Europe playing rugby than there were on Tuesday,\u2019 he jokes. Flats talks to Sportsmail's Jonny Singer on arrival at Twickenham at the end of his 'Tour de Flats' England came up short against France in the Six Nations, but their style of play earned plenty of plaudits . \u2018But I think what it needs is a concerted effort to make as much noise, constructive noise, about the Rugby World Cup as possible.\u2019 At the heart of the \u2018legacy\u2019 debate, as it was with the Olympics, is the discussion over grassroots sport, and it\u2019s something that Flats\u2019 tour has been focused on. \u2018We went to a club in Leicester, with Mike Tindall and Ben Kay, and this is a club, with nothing,\u2019 he recounts. \u2018They have absolutely nothing. Part of the World Cup legacy is they will receive upgrades to their facilities. Now, at Wasps or Harlequins, that means 5,000 extra seats. For them that means a shower. \u2018Not shower rooms. A shower. They don\u2019t have one. All this sort of stuff, that\u2019s the grassroots.\u2019 Of course, as well as investment and infrastructure, what this World Cup will bring, Stuart Lancaster will hope, is an England team playing with confidence in front of their own fans. For the World Cup to be the inspiration it has the potential to be, England\u2019s performances will matter. If Stuart Lancaster's side can repeat their flowing rugby at the World Cup, they can win the sport fans . Flatman says picking the likes of Danny Cipriani is key to England bringing in new fans during the tournament . \u2018A lot of the buzz and the legacy around the World Cup will be how England play,\u2019 admits Flats. \u2018How far they get is one side of it, another side is how they perform. \u2018They didn\u2019t do enough against France (in last month\u2019s Six Nations) because they didn\u2019t win, but they were fantastic, and everyone loves it, and everyone forgives that. \u2018So they want to win, first and foremost, but how they do so will have a big impact.\u2019 Playing attractive rugby is not just a question of attitude, it also depends on personnel, and that is why the former England prop is so glad to see the return of one of the country\u2019s most exciting players, Danny Cipriani. Cipriani may have a reputation as a \u2018pretty boy\u2019 but, for Flats, that can\u2019t mask the fact that he is a top player. \u2018He\u2019s not a prima donna. Someone gets photographed at a fashion show, and has nice hair, and they say you\u2019re a prima donna. \u2018Sam Warburton\u2019s got nice hair and big guns; If he went to Cardiff fashion week he wouldn\u2019t be a prima donna because he\u2019s a hard-nut flanker, and he\u2019s not a fly half. Cipriani was recalled for the Six Nations after impressing at club level over the past few seasons . Flats says investment in the grass-roots will also be important if the Rugby World Cup is to have a legacy . \u2018You can\u2019t have a prima donna in the forwards. Why is Danny Cipriani? Just because he\u2019s prettier and smaller. He\u2019s a good bloke and an amazing rugby player. \u2018We talk about inspiring young people, who do you think the kids \u201care\u201d in the playground now, playing rugby? \u2018A lot of them will be saying, \u201cI\u2019m Danny Cipriani\u201d. I thought he deserved to get back in the England squad and I\u2019m glad they picked him.\u2019 So, if England play at their fluent best, and the grass roots get the funding they so badly need, could the rugby World Cup produce a new generation of players and fans? Flats thinks so, but only if the tournament is made accessible. \u2018There\u2019s a big responsibility of commentators and pundits, without dumbing things down, to simplify things a bit,\u2019 he explains. \u2018Offer clarity, and make people who might be first time watchers, like they understand it more. \u2018 . If that understand can join the enthusiasm that is clearly building, England could have a tournament with lasting legacy \u2013 and not just in south west London.

Tom Arscott scored a brace of tries for Sale as Mike Haley claimed the other with Danny Cipriani kicking two penalties and a conversion. Prop, Richard Palframan, made his first Premiership start the hosts with Jebb Sinclair recalled in the back row. Shane Geraghty was an absentee with Chris Noakes included at fly-half and Fergus Mulchrone in the centre. Scott Steele was a late withdrawal after failing a fitness test with Darren Allinson coming in at scrum half. Sale's starting line-up was unchanged from their win over Gloucester but hooker, Marc Jones, returned on the bench. Exiles centre\u00a0Eoin Griffin is tackle by Sale powerhouse\u00a0Sam Tuitupou . Straight from the kick-off, Irish made simple errors, giving the visitors a platform to attack and with Cipriani pulling the strings, Sale created an overlap providing Arscott with an easy run-in. Irish missed an early opportunity for points by declining to take a kickable penalty and it proved the wrong option as their attacking line-out failed to provide any dividend. Irish suffered a blow when they lost lock Richard Skuse to injury with Luke Narraway coming on as his replacement. The opening period was played at a frenetic pace with Irish struggling to cope as Sale were all action, moving the ball at every opportunity, displaying some extremely slick handling. However against the run play, Irish produced an excellent movement with Allinson, Narraway and Fergus Mulchrone all prominent and they succeeded in winning a penalty, which Noakes kicked to leave his side trailing 5-3 at the end of the first quarter. Noakes then rewarded a period of pressure from Irish to kick his second penalty as it was now the turn of the visitors, to make the elementary errors. Sale were also conceding a number of penalties at the scrum area and from one of these, Noakes should have put Irish further ahead but his attempt was off target. Sale scrum half\u00a0Chris Cusiter attempts to make a clearance kick under pressure from the Exiles defence . After 33 minutes, Irish prop, Tom Court, was sin-binned for dragging down a driving line-out and Sale took immediate advantage when Haley outflanked the Irish cover defence to score a well-created try. With the last kick of the half, Noakes attempted a penalty from inside his own half. It fell short but for some inexplicable reason, Cipriani chose to run the ball from within his own 22 and his pass to Haley was fumbled by the full back. Irish capitalised with Fenby seizing the loose ball to race away for the try, which Noakes converted for a 13-10 interval lead.

Court returned but Irish were soon back down to 14 men when Blair Cowan was yellow carded for a deliberate offside with Cipriani making no mistake with the resulting kick to tie up the scores. Sale took further advantage of Cowan's absence to score their third try and Arscott's second. The wing again outflanked the home cover but the scoring pass from Haley looked suspiciously forward. Irish fought back and they appeared to have scored when a driving maul crashed over the visitors' line but the TMO was unable to confirm the grounding. It did not matter for long as Sale's Chris Cusiter was yellow carded which give Irish a hance to score their second through Lewington. Topsy Ojo was the next to receive a yellow card, this one for dangerous play but Irish overcame this setback when Lewington brushed aside some weak tackling to score his second. Noakes converted to give Irish a 25-20 lead at the end of the third quarter.

That made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage, and speaking afterwards Sturridge said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at Liverpool but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for Sterling. 'I don't know what Raheem wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly,' he told Press Association Sport. 'As long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - I don't think it is anything to with anything other than that and I hope he will stay at the club. 'It is important, regardless of who you are, to show what you can do - not just for Raheem but any young player. 'It is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes I am behind him 100 per cent.' Sturridge experienced something similar himself when he left Manchester City for Chelsea aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at Stamford Bridge and he left for Liverpool in January 2012 after 63 appearances in four years. As he matured he has enjoyed greater success at Anfield, scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five-month absence with a thigh problem.

Chelsea face United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in the Barclays Premier League and both Sportsmail\u00a0columnist Carragher and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville believe Mourinho will bring Kurt Zouma into his midfield to neutralise Fellaini. The French centre back started in the middle of the park in last month's Capital One Cup final and has become an emergency option for the league leaders in that unfamiliar role of late. Marouane Fellaini has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in Manchester United's midfield of late . Jamie Carragher believes Jose Mourinho will bring Kurt Zouma into his midfield to neutralise Fellaini . Carragher and Gary Neville agreed that Mourinho would have a special plan to stop United's run of form . Carragher and Neville were speaking as part of Monday Night Football ahead of Liverpool vs Newcastle United . But with United on such good form, having won their last six league games, Mourinho will need to find a way to put a stop to Louis van Gaal's team and Carragher and Neville see Fellaini as the main target. Carragher sees the Special One retreating into his shell with a midfield incorporating Zouma, Nemanja Matic and Ramires as they look to deny Fellaini and the rest of United's midfield that they have thrived in. 'Jose Mourinho very rarely gets done tactically in a big game. His record is fantastic,' Carragher said. 'There's no doubt, he won't go in with just his normal set-up, he'll use something different. I'm convinced of it. 'Jose Mourinho very rarely gets done tactically in a big game. His record is fantastic,' Carragher said . Fellaini could be targeted by Mourinho in midfield as he looks to find a way of stopping United on Saturday . Gary Cahill, John Terry and Zouma (L-R) could all be involved from the start in the game at Stamford Bridge . Zouma has emerged as an emergency option for Chelsea when they need strength in the midfield area . 'I think there's a case for bringing Zouma into midfield, maybe get him on Fellaini, because Matic is left-footed and he won't want to put him on the right side of central midfield. 'I imagine he will maybe play Ramires instead of Willian and tuck him right in to fill spaces around there. (Mourinho will) play Zouma as more like a third centre back, but slightly ahead of (Gary) Cahill and (John) Terry just to look after Fellaini. 'I'm convinced he won't allow the space and the problems they cause down that left side to happen. He will set up and stop it, I'm convinced of it.' Mourinho will not want to give United space and that means that he will set up to stop them, says Carragher . Ramires was also picked out as a potential player to be used in midfield, with Willian missing out . Neville agreed, and went as far as to say that Mourinho would focus on 'destruction' before hoping to win by taking advantage of set-pieces or the skill of Eden Hazard in his analysis on Monday Night Football. The former Manchester United captain also made it clear that while he expects Mourinho to have a plan for the game, he does not see his charges winning their next three games against United, Arsenal and Leicester City to take the Premier League title at the earliest possible opportunity. 'I think he'll just think destruction first and foremost, he'll think how I'm going to stop them and then how I'm going to win the game,' Neville said. Neville commented on how Mourinho would be focused on 'destruction', having Zouma 'sacrificing himself' 'I think Zouma coming in is a good point, it will be alongside Matic in midfield. Zouma will sit a little bit to the right and just sacrifice himself in the game. 'That will then give them (Branislav) Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Zouma, Matic, (Didier) Drogba potentially, and he'll think: \"I can win this game either by a bit of magic from Hazard or by set-pieces\". He'll play the long game. 'His team aren't playing very well, United are playing better than them at this moment in time.

That result means the club, partly owned by United legends Phil and Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, were crowned champions in the high-profile quintet's first season at the helm. FC United manager Karl Marginson, who has been with the club since day one, believes 'anything is possible'. 'We've got a ground of our own,' he said, before a fan planted a kiss on his cheek. 'There's no reason why the league is not possible. We have to provide that for these supporters because they deserve it.' Marginson admits he did not know what to expect when he took over the fledgling club. 'I didn't know what to think,' he said. 'I didn't have a clue. But it's something I'm immensely proud of. It's something we have to hold onto.' Fans storm the pitch as the breakaway outfit celebrates a significant moment in their short history . When asked how he was going to celebrate Marginson added: 'I'm going to go to the Nag's Head if it's open when I get home.' General Manager Andy Walsh, who has also been with FC from the beginning, echoed his manager's comments. 'We will assess where we are going to go,' he said. 'We're not in a hurry and we've always been about building for the long-term. This is a football club that is built on the ambitions and beliefs of its supporters. 'I think the Football League is very possible. We have a manager and coaching staff that have shown they can challenge.

{"input": "Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force.

Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan.

Paranormal investigator Jayne Harris, based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire,\u00a0said she has received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains, nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of Peggy, who she believed to be possessed with an evil spirit. Some reported flashing visions of 'mental institutions and treatment bordering on abuse' and overwhelming feelings of anxiety. Scroll down for video . Video footage of Peggy (pictured) has been wreaking havoc on a string of paranormal enthusiasts around the world \u2013 reportedly causing one British woman to suffer a heart attack . One woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, even suffered an alleged heart attack after watching a video of Mrs Harris and Peggy in a car together on March 16. 'If I had to guess, I'd say close to 80 people have came forward with experiences,' said Mrs Harris, who has been studying spirit attachment since the death of her  cousin Kelly in 2000. 'Some are small, like computer screens freezing, sharp headaches or a sense of dread, but others are more disturbing. 'One lady said that when she opened a photograph of Peggy, her computer froze on the picture and the room went cold. 'She then said she felt someone in the room with her and could hear them moving around.This lady was messaging me at the time via Facebook asking me to quickly advise her on what to do. 'I took Peggy down into an isolation area and requested that she cease her tormenting. Apparently everything returned to normal.' Paranormal investigator Jayne Harris (left) said she received an influx of messages from people describing chest pains, nausea and crippling headaches after viewing photos and videos of Peggy (right) Mrs Harris continued: 'Another lady yesterday said she had been experiencing light bulbs blowing and a presence in her home after she had been speaking about Peggy. 'With Peggy, it's not only while people are looking at her or watching her, it seems to be afterwards too.' Mrs Harris, who has herself experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with Peggy, said she has never seen a case of this intensity before. She runs an organisation called Haunted Dolls, and often gets random items in the post with no prior background. Mrs Harris uses an array of gadgets and experiments to piece together the puzzles surrounding them. Mrs Harris, pictured conducting a ritual with the doll, has experienced migraines and feeling drained after working with Peggy, and said she has never seen a case of this intensity before . Peggy was sent to her recently after her previous owner reported a series of terrifying nightmares. 'She\u2019d wake feeling hot and shaken,' Mrs Harris said. 'No matter where she moved the doll to in her home, the nightmares persisted. She apparently sought the help of a local priest but two visits later and there was no change. 'In September she became quite ill with a fever and began suffering hallucinations. 'When she recovered, she saw no other option but to get rid of the doll as she was convinced it was at the centre of all that had been happening. 'I think she Googled \"haunted dolls\" and came upon our website. She didn\u2019t want us to go to her home to conduct experiments as we usually would, but instead sent the doll to us.' There is still a shroud of mystery surrounding Peggy\u2019s religion, according to Mrs Harris, but she appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear . The team, along with members of Haunted Dolls\u2019 social media groups, have been trying to put together a clearer picture of the spectre inhabiting Peggy. It is thought she is possessed by the spirit of a woman born in 1946 in London\u2019s Holland Park who died of a chest-related condition - possibly an asthma attack \u2013 and strongly dislikes clowns. Four different psychic mediums have \u2018read\u2019 Peggy, all invariably picking up that she is restless, frustrated and was persecuted in life. 'We have been told she can affect people\u2019s dreams,' Mrs Harris said. 'She recently visited a lady in her dreams, warning her about one of her cats. 'The next morning, the lady found her cat very ill and he sadly died that day.' There is still a shroud of mystery surrounding Peggy\u2019s religion, according to Mrs Harris. She appears to have an aversion to a crucifix necklace she was previously made to wear, suggesting she is not a Christian. 'A lot of people, including two mediums, have said they feel she has links to the Holocaust and was possibly Jewish,' said Mrs Harris. 'We have conducted automatic writing sessions with her in which the words \"star\" and the name \"David\" came up, so there is possibly a link there.' After a recent session with Peggy during which Mrs Harris made notes, she left the room and returned to find that Peggy had moved the notebook high up to the joists of her ceiling (pictured) It was during the automatic writing session \u2013 a ritual whereby a psychic will communicate with a spirit, producing any messages they have without consciously writing \u2013 that an cryptic instruction was passed on to a member of the Haunted Dolls community. The woman in question, a developing medium known as Lindy, had experienced paranormal activity related to Peggy before when her Facebook page kept posting comments about the doll over and over again. 'When I commented my thoughts and feelings [about Peggy] all my comments were duplicated \u2013 no one else\u2019s, just mine,' she said. 'I tried commenting on other threads and nothing happened, but I soon as I went back to that one the same thing happened. My dog started barking and my face became very hot and flushed. I felt like I wasn\u2019t alone. 'I ended up apologising to Peggy as I felt maybe she disproved of us chatting about her and my symptoms stopped.' Mrs Harris uses a K-II meter (pictured) during her paranormal investigations, which pick up ghostly 'activity' Three days later, another Peggy video inspired Lindy to have an overdue conversation with her daughter about how they were to deal with her mental health issues. 'My daughter has been unwell for months and things were strained and stressful,' she said. 'Late that morning, I found myself having a much needed heart-to-heart with her. 'All the things I had wanted to say for months were just flowing from my mouth. 'I\u2019ve found it very difficult communicating in such a way with her due to her illness. I felt that Peggy had helped me.' Lindy did not know that the automatic writing session with Peggy was taking place, but when she logged onto Facebook and saw images of the messages received during the session, one seemed to be for her.

{"input": "Liverpool defender Kolo Toure insists a 'sad' Steven Gerrard will deal with the reality of being denied a fairytale FA Cup final farewell. The former Ivory Coast international said the team was probably more disappointed at not being able to deliver a trophy for fans, who this season had seen their side fail to progress out of the Champions League group stage and lose to Chelsea in the last four of the Capital One Cup. A 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa at Wembley ended the club's last hope of silverware and meant Gerrard would not be given a perfect send off ahead of his summer move to Los Angeles Galaxy with a cup final appearance on his 35th birthday on what would have been his very last for his boyhood club. Kolo Toure (left) admitted Steven Gerrard was 'sad' after the loss but he also felt sorry for Liverpool's fans . 'You feel bad. It is always difficult when you lose a semi-final like that,' Toure told Press Association Sport. 'The defeat is the thing. Of course we wanted to do very well for the last game of Stevie for the club but at the end of the day, we wanted to do it for the fans because this club deserves to have a trophy. 'He (Gerrard) is fine. Of course he is sad, like all the dressing room, but he has been in this game for a long time and he knows how to deal with these situations.' Gerrard was able to start the match after an injury to Lucas Leiva in training, which denied Liverpool some much-needed control in midfield. The former England captain looks dejected after the final whistle and his hopes of a final trophy ended . However, Toure insisted they should have had the ability to cope without their only genuine defensive midfielder. 'Lucas is a great player but we had players who could do the job,' he added. 'Collectively we were not very good. Villa really fought and gave everything to win the game.' As a result, Brendan Rodgers became the first Liverpool manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years. Gerrard didn't get his fairytale ending at Wembley as he leaves the club at the end of the season for LA Galaxy . With the club's Champions League qualification hopes looking increasingly distant after Manchester City's win over West Ham on Sunday increased the gap to fourth place to seven points - although Liverpool now have a match in hand - the Reds boss will find his record coming under more scrutiny over the final six games of the season. The Northern Irishman insists he and his players will not give up while there is still a mathematical possibility. 'There's an obligation here to fight to the very end,' he said. 'We have to fight in every single game now. Of course there will be disappointment over the next couple of days but we're going to have to get ready.' Brendan Rodgers became the first manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years . Despite an impressive run of form since the turn of the year, Liverpool have looked ineffective in the big games, with back-to-back defeats to Manchester United and Arsenal putting a huge dent in their top-four hopes just when it seemed they were about to make the breakthrough, having worked so hard to get within two points of the top-four. 'The start of the season was not so good for various reasons then we picked it up,' said Rodgers. 'We played very well and had great rhythm to our game then we've had a block of games where the performance level hasn't been what we'd like. 'The team in the last couple of years have shown great energy, attitude and commitment - I thought our energy was low (against Villa). The Reds boss admitted that Aston Villa deserved the victory as they progressed to the FA Cup final . 'They had a good start to the game and we were too passive in the game. 'We changed the system, got some joy and got in front but we didn't keep the lead long enough. 'In the second half we hoped to play better but we just didn't create enough. 'We needed to change the game to get more thrust going forward but even then the numbers getting forward weren't what we're normally used to.'", "answer": "Kolo Toure admitted that Steven Gerrard was sad after the FA Cup defeat .\nLiverpool were beaten 2-1 by Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium on Sunday .\nToure says the team are more disappointed to not win a trophy for the fans .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .", "completion": ["Liverpool defender Kolo Toure says Steven Gerrard is \"sad\" after being denied a fairytale FA Cup final farewell, but insists the team is more disappointed about not delivering a trophy for fans."]}
{"input": "A frustrated Arsenal fan who jumped over a barrier and ran towards the manager during an away match at Southampton has been banned from going to games for three years. Luke Bryant, 25, was sat with Southampton fans when he ran onto the sidelines of the football pitch during a game at St Mary's stadium, where Arsenal were losing 2-0. Bryant admitted 'going onto an area adjacent to a playing area' of the Football Act 1991, where he shrugged his shoulders at Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The fan, who Arsene Wenger thought was from the Southampton end, runs to the dugout and gestures . Stewards quickly led the man away as Arsenal manager Wenger shows little reaction to the confrontation . Wenger was confronted by an angry fan during the poor performance at St Mary's on New Year's Day . The father-of-two, who works in retail, said in court that he was frustrated with his club and 'just wanted his voice heard'. Bryant, who has been a football fan since he was six years old, said he went over an advertising board - which stood at around two feet - to get onto the side of the pitch. He said: 'It was sheer frustration at how the club was doing. I just wanted my voice heard.' Bryant told Southampton Magistrates Court he put his arms out and shrugged at Arsenal manager Wenger before being taken away by the stewards during the match on January 1. He said: 'I got to the front of the subs stand. I was there for a few seconds. 'I stood there and shrugged my shoulders. I pointed towards the pitch to say it was not good enough and that was it.' Bryant, who has no previous convictions, said he had been contacted by 'unhappy' Southampton fans who made threats and which made his partner fearful for them and their two children and that he had reported the incidents to police. He added that he had his car keyed and was due to promotion to supervisor but was unsuccessful as a result of the incident. Bryant, a 'fully fledged' Arsenal fan of Lymington, Hants,, said: 'This experience has not been a pleasant one. 'The moment I stepped onto that pitch and saw the Arsenal manager, I felt guilty. 'It was stupid - five minutes of madness.' Wenger feels the strain as Arsenal succumbed to a two-goal defeat against Southampton . Wenger gestures towards the fourth official on the touchline during a frustrating afternoon for Arsenal . Prosecuting Simon Jones said: 'If Mr Bryant's frustration is with the way the club is being run then the court have to decide about further behaviour, as he said himself there is not going to be a change in management for the foreseeable future.' Defending Stephen Tricker said: 'He is saying 'I have learnt my lesson.' 'Mr Bryants says 'the mere experience of everything that is happening is significantly terrible for me not to make the same mistake twice'.' Judge Anthony Carloway said: 'In the case of Bryant it is common ground, he unwisely decided to leave his allocated seat, mount an advertising board some two feet high and approach the manager Mr Arsene Wenger with outstretched arms. 'I understand from Mr Bryant the purpose of that activity was to reflect his opinion of the club also that he says the club is divided and his unhappiness at the club's structure and performance and so on.' He added that a journalist who interviewed the manager after the match asked him about the incident. Wenger answered that he thought the 'young boy' was a Southampton fan and was 'not aggressive at all'. He said that Bryant's actions were 'emotional' rather than planned. Bryant was placed under a banning order for three years and fined \u00a3500. He was also ordered to pay \u00a3200 court costs.

'I'm really excited about the rest of the year now. It's a good momentum starter for me,' said Rose, who was looking to become the first European player to win the US Open and Masters. Justin Rose was unable to take victory at the Masters, despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at Augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of Rory McIlroy, who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . 'I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about April to September when the big tournaments come around and that's when I want to play well. 'You look at Rory's year last year, it was all about how he played in the summer (winning the Open, Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA in the space of four weeks). I was trying to keep telling myself it's a long year. Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship. 'The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that I have not been in contention and I haven't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw. 'I was really pleased at how comfortable I felt in that situation, last group in the Masters on Sunday. I think that's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon.' Rose began the final round four shots behind Spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine, but was never able to get any closer. 'There's two ways to look at it.

Wade, 23, did not attend and clearly infuriated veteran  Goode, who will join London Irish in the summer . Sportsmail understands that Wade pulled out because of an injury rehabilitation session the following morning but, despite the event\u2019s success, Goode did not hold back with his public criticism.

{"input": "France legend Serge Betsen tells Sportsmail where he thinks Clermont's clash with Saracens at\u00a0Stade Geoffrey-Guichard will be won... HEAD TO HEADS . Wesley Fofana v Brad Barritt . If there is one genius in French rugby at the moment, it\u2019s Wesley Fofana. The kid is so talented and skilful that something happens every time he gets the ball so Saracens will need to focus on him. He is up against Brad Barritt, who is not as easy on the eye but is a very solid unit for Saracens \u2014 hence why they have made him captain. He reminds me of former British Lions flanker Richard Hill \u2014 someone you don\u2019t really notice but is so important for the team. Clermont centre Wesley Fofana was in scintillating form during his side's recent destruction of Northampton . Brad Barritt is back to anchor the Saracens midfield against the Top 14 giants . Julien Bonnaire vs Billy Vunipola . Julien Bonnaire may be a flanker and Billy Vunipola a No 8, but when you play flanker, you\u2019re the first man who is going to tackle the No 8. Saracens will be looking to launch Vunipola as chief ball-carrier from the back of the scrum and Bonnaire will be there to stop him. Fritz Lee performs a similar running role for Clermont, but Vunipola is key to Saracens\u2019 game plan. No 8 Billy Vunipola is a Saracens' most devastating ball carrier and his power will be needed on Saturday . Brock James v Charlie Hodgson . How will Brock James handle the occasion? His skills and game management are second-to-none, but he has been known to succumb to the pressure on the big stage. Saracens will try to get in his face early to disrupt the rhythm. Charlie Hodgson has been around for a long time now and is enjoying some good form. KEY AREAS . Rush defence . A red and black wall of defenders stopped Clermont from scoring a try in last year\u2019s semi-final, which Saracens won so ruthlessly. Their defensive line was up so quickly and Clermont were taken by surprise. When you play against that sort of rush defence, you need to stand deeper in attack and maybe exploit it by kicking over the top. But Clermont are most effective with the ball in hand, especially with their back-three combination of Noa Nakaitaci, Naipolioni Nalaga and Englishman Nick Abendanon. Former Bath full back\u00a0Nick Abendanon is just one of several dangerous backs at Clermont's disposal . Breakdown battle . In France, training is geared more towards flair and creativity so less time is spent working on the breakdown. During my time with Wasps, we spent hours focusing on the post-tackle area. Clermont will fear Jacques Burger after his performance on the flank last year and they must work hard to nullify him around the edges of the breakdown. The key for the French is to keep their discipline and not concede penalties. Clermont will be wary of Saracens flanker\u00a0Jacques Burger following his tour-de-force in Twickenham last year . Silence the crowd . Although this game is being played at a \u2018neutral\u2019 venue, it will still feel like a home game for Clermont. The Top 14 side have the best supporters in French rugby and it\u2019s only a 90-mile journey to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in St Etienne for their fans, who follow their side everywhere. Saracens must be wary of the reception they\u2019ll get but they can keep the fans quiet by building an early lead. When Clermont are behind, their heads can drop.

The 31-year-old from Leicester rocked Ronnie O'Sullivan in last year's final to claim his maiden Crucible title, and returned to ease 6-3 ahead of Kurt Maflin in their first-round tussle. No first-time champion in Sheffield has returned to retain the trophy 12 months on, and that factor has taken the tag of the 'Crucible curse'. Mark Selby plays a shot in the first round match against Kurt Maflin on day one of the World Championship . Mark Selby and Norwegian Kurt Maflin look on during their first round match at the Crucible in Sheffield . Selby salutes the Crucible crowd on his arrival . Selby is equipped with the form to be a repeat winner, having lifted the German Masters and China Open titles this year, and breaks of 84, 108, 53, 69 and 56 gave him a commanding lead to take into the evening session. His match with Maflin concludes on Saturday, the only clash to reach a finish on day one of the tournament, and Selby looked like being too strong for his London-born opponent who currently represents Norway, where he has lived for more than a decade. Maflin defeated Steve Davis in the qualifying stages, and he beat Selby in Germany last year, but this was a Crucible debut for the 31-year-old. Selby, despite being just two months older than Maflin, is an old hand at the tournament, having made his first World Championship appearance 10 years ago. They shared the four frames before the mid-session interval, Maflin making runs of 96 and 60, before Selby opened a two-frame lead and then also claimed the seventh after a re-spotted black. It looked a pivotal frame, as Maflin twice attempted to double in the black but on the second occasion left Selby a long pot, which he fired assuredly into the centre of the pocket. Selby match against Maflin concludes on Saturday, the only clash to finish on day one of the tournament . Back came Maflin with an 88 break, but when Selby bustled through the last of the session he had a commanding advantage to take into the concluding session, needing just four more frames to reach the second round.

{"input": "The first double hundred of Alex Hales' career helped Nottinghamshire into a position of strength on the opening day of their LV= County Championship match against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge. The England international was unbeaten on 222 not out as the home side reached 393 for seven by stumps, having been invited to bat first. Hales scored his runs from 250 balls, with 37 fours and a six and having shared in a third wicket stand of 171 with James Taylor, who scored 59. Steven Patterson, with two for 58 and Jack Brooks, two for 90, returned the leading figures for the Yorkshire bowlers on a tough day for the defending Champions. Alex Hales, pictured in action for Nottinghamshire earlier this month, completed a double century on Sunday . Hales' passed three figures for the 10th time in his career, spoiling the return of Andrew Gale, back skippering Yorkshire again after serving a four match suspension. Gale rotated all seven bowlers at his disposal but all found it difficult to put the brake on Hales' scoring. In general, too much width was offered to the 26-year-old and he capitalised fully to reach his century from 131 balls and his 150 from 173. Taylor was a perfect foil for his World Cup team-mate, content to play the supportive role in reaching his own 50 from 89 balls, with nine fours.Yorkshire's spirits\u00a0were lifted just before the tea interval when Brooks struck twice in an over, snaring Taylor with an lbw decision and then providing enough temptation for Samit Patel to nudge one into the hands of Alex Lees at first slip. Riki Wessels made 18 before falling just before the taking of the second new ball, guiding Nottingham-born Will Rhodes to second slip. Hales, in action during an England nets session in Australia in March, hasn't given up on playing Test cricket . Hales went past his previous best of 184, made against Somerset in 2011, and then had his only two scares of the day, against the bowling of Patterson. An uppish chip to mid-on was totally missed by Rhodes, who claimed he lost the flight of the ball. On 197 a huge shout for lbw was turned down by umpire Russell Evans, to the dismay of the entire fielding unit. A four off Bresnan eased home nerves, though, and a standing ovation was duly afforded Hales for reaching the 200 landmark from 234 deliveries. He will return on the second morning, after the final over of the day was cut short following the dismissal of Will Gidman, also caught in the slip cordon, off Patterson. Nottinghamshire's openers both made 27 before the visiting attack struck twice during the morning session. Steven Mullaney was given out lbw to Patterson, beaten by one that came back and missed the inside edge. Brendan Taylor, who had scored centuries in both of his first class appearances this season, became a notable first scalp for Matthew Fisher, who at 17 years 161 days is Yorkshire's sixth youngest debutant, but it mattered little once Hales got to work. Hales hopes his brilliant knock against Yorkshire sends a message to the England selectors . Hales said: 'It's a very proud day for me to make that score against the county champions and against a very good attack. 'I'm very pleased with how the day has gone, it has been one of those days where all the shots I've tried have come off. 'They bowled pretty well at me in the morning session but I knew if I got through it, it would become easier and I'd be all right.' Asked if his knock had sent any sort of message to the England selectors, he added: 'I hope to show that I can make scores in all three formats. 'This year I want to make as many big scores as I can in this format because it's still my dream to play Test cricket.' Yorkshire captain Gale said: 'We weren't at our best today but fair play to Alex Hales. 'I thought he played really well - a chanceless innings really - but we only bowled to 60 or 70 per cent of our potential. 'It was a good toss to win, there was plenty in the wicket in the first session but we didn't utilise it. 'It was just nice to get back out over the white line and get 96 overs in the legs. I hope we can get it right in the morning and bowl them out quickly.'", "answer": "Alex Hales was unbeaten on 222 not out for Nottinghamshire who reached 393 for seven by stumps in their clash against Yorkshire .\nIt is the first double hundred of Hales' career \u00a0passing previous best of 184 .\nAnd Hales said it is still his 'dream' to play Test cricket for England .", "completion": ["Alex Hales' first double hundred of his career helped Nottinghamshire into a position of strength on the opening day of their LV= County Championship match against Yorkshire at Trent Bridge."]}
{"input": "Hull boss Steve Bruce has admitted his side need to pull off a couple of 'crazy results' if they are to preserve their Premier League status in a frantic end-of-season run-in. The Tigers head to Southampton on Saturday without a win in five games and perching just two points above the bottom three after wins last week for QPR and Leicester. And Bruce hopes the unpredictable nature of this season's top flight will continue into the final weeks, with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United still due to visit the KC Stadium. Steve Bruce admitted his side need some 'crazy results' if they're going to avoid relegation from the league . Bruce said: 'We have just witnessed over the last week all sorts of crazy results can happen and we need to make sure we get one or two of those, that's for sure. 'We've proved this year that we're capable but we're under no illusions how difficult it is going to be. It is all to play for and it is another big weekend but we have been saying that for the best part of four months. 'The way it's gone all season I wouldn't be surprised if it goes right down to the wire. Last week people were saying QPR and Leicester were gone but all of a sudden they've produced a result and they're back in it again.' Hull face high-flying Southampton knowing that they can't afford to slip up with the bottom three closing . Bruce's biggest selection dilemma for the trip to the south coast is whether to keep faith in goalkeeper Allan McGregor after a pair of high-profile blunders in recent weeks. McGregor was at fault for the opening goal in the 3-1 defeat at Swansea last week and also made a mistake in the loss to Chelsea a fortnight ago, but Bruce sprung to the defence of the under-fire 33-year-old. Bruce said: 'When you're a goalkeeper the one thing the Premier League does is highlight mistakes and unfortunately Allan will be the first to admit he has been disappointed over the last couple of weeks. Allan McGregor (right) could lose his place in the side after a pair of blunders in Hull's recent defeats . 'I haven't made a decision one way or the other, but Allan is a very, very good goalkeeper. Despite his mistakes he is still a top-class keeper.' Veteran Steve Harper is pushing to replace McGregor in Bruce's starting line-up while midfielder Tom Huddlestone is also set to make a welcome return from suspension. However David Meyler is ruled out after his red card last week, Gaston Ramirez is ineligible to play against his parent club and Curtis Davies is an injury doubt. Tom Huddlestone (left) and Andrew Robertson are in line to return for the Tigers after suspension and injury . And Bruce acknowledged his side face a major battle to boost their survival prospects against Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints whom he rates as the best outside the traditional 'big guns'. 'We will have to be somewhere near our best if we are going to get anything out of them because I rate them very highly,' added Bruce. 'They lost three or four players for big money but they have bought well. They have maintained their position at the top end of the league so fair play to Ronald Koeman and the way the club is run from top to bottom.'", "answer": "Steve Bruce admits Hull need to pull off 'crazy results' to avoid the drop .\nThe Tigers still have to play Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United .\nHull are just two points away from the bottom three of the Premier League .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Hull news .", "completion": ["Hull boss Steve Bruce admits his team needs 'crazy results' to avoid relegation from the Premier League, as they head into a game against Southampton without a win in five games and only two points above the bottom three."]}
{"input": "The records are tumbling and Leicester\u2019s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson\u2019s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester\u2019s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King\u2019s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked \u2013 and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester\u2019s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through \u2013 a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea \u2013 just 68.3 per cent \u2013 but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper\u00a0Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel\u2019s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel \u2013 only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt \u2013 and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's\u00a0Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson\u2019s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester\u2019s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. \u2018If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,\u2019 he said. \u2018Now with a good result and we have to push on.\u2019 A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .", "answer": "Leicester have recorded three consecutive Premier League wins .\nThe latest, a 2-0 success over Swansea, lifted them to 17th in the table .\nNigel Pearson's side are starting to dream of beating relegation .\nEsteban Cambiasso has been superb for the Foxes this season .\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has also hit some timely form .", "completion": ["Leicester City Football Club's 2-0 victory over Swansea marks their third consecutive Premier League win, lifting them to 17th place and ending their five-month spell at the bottom."]}

{"input": "The Fulham fans in the Jimmy Steed Stand applauded their team at the final whistle. It was not the victory manager Kit Symons had called for but a point away to Charlton probably secures their future in the Championship next season. They are eight points clear of Millwall and bar a miraculous resurgence from one of the bottom three sides will stay up but the fact relegation is still mathematically feasible for a club that were in the Premier League last season is alarming. A vertiginous decline, just one victory in their last seven games had seen them dragged back into a relegation battle and after a painful 4-1 trouncing by bitter rivals Brentford last week, Symons was looking for a quick response from his players. Johann Gudmundsson celebrates his first-half effort as Charlton come from behind to earn a point . The Icelandic winger is joined by his Charlton teammates as they celebrate his equaliser at The Valley . He got it with Ross McCormack giving them the lead after eight minutes. A superb long ball by Michael Turner found Matt Smith who headed on to the Scotsman to loop the ball over the top of Charlton goalkeeper Stephen Henderson in front of the 1620 travelling fans in the Jimmy Seed stand. The passage of time has clearly not dulled the bad feeling Charlton fans harbour towards Scott Parker. The midfielder, who missed the Brentford game through illness, departed the club more than a decade ago but his every touch of the ball was greeted by a chorus of boos. Not that it seemed to affect him as he dictated the pace of the game in the early stages, feeding striker Smith well.

But Charlton hit back with a 16th minute equaliser. Morgan Fox\u2019s cross bounced across the front of goal and Frederic Bulot swung a leg at it but could not connect. It was left for a waiting Johann Gudmundsson to fire his 10th goal of the season into the top right corner. Goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli, who seemed rooted to the spot, wisely dragged a furious James Husband, who seemed to believe the goal offside, from a confrontation with the linesman. Almost the whole stadium thought Gudmundsson had nabbed his second when Igor Vetokele set him up with the whole goal to aim at but the winger contrived to miss, hitting the side netting instead. The second half was low in quality but high in chances. The visitors seemed reenergised after the interval, forcing a save in the 46th minute. Matt Smith found space in the centre of the box and got his head on a pinpoint James Husband cross but Henderson did well to thwart the effort. Charlton soon asserted control with Tony Watt going close three times before Parker was booked for bringing him down with a late challenge. The Charlton players were outraged when referee Andy Madley awarded Fulham a free kick 25 yards out deep into stoppage time but McCormack blasted the ball over the bar.

{"input": "Adrian Heath is holding court at his weekly pre-match press conference, and one of the local reporters wants to talk crossbars. Might it be a good idea to raise it a bit so more goals could be scored for the benefit of goal-hungry American fans? The well-travelled former Everton and Manchester City midfielder \u2013 now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City \u2013 responds with good humour. 'Well, soccer's being doing quite well for about 150 years now and if you look at the amount of people who play and watch it's still doing quite well, so I don't really see a need,' he replies with a patient smile. Scroll down for video . Adrian Heath is manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City . Such inquiries are actually becoming fewer and further between, as the world game and the huge US market get better acquainted with each other. Heath has been here for eight years now and witnessed the process at first hand, going from the backwoods of the USL to the major leagues that Orlando have been elevated to this season. The years have not dimmed Heath's impish enthusiasm and, now 53, he speaks of the game's expansion with an almost missionary zeal. Perched in the morning sunshine on a bench at City's pristine training facility he talks about the upside of salary caps, what Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard can expect, the humility of his star signing Kaka and his hopes of an eventual rivalry with David Beckham's troubled Miami project. Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in the summer after spending 17 seasons at Liverpool . Midfielder Frank Lampard has signed a two-year contract with New York City . The aforementioned names' imminent arrival is just one reason why the MLS is achieving a greater resonance on the other side of the Atlantic. ' I think English people are fascinated with America,' says Heath. ' You see the baseball, American football and basketball and wonder whether football can take off here. I'm glad to say I think the only question is how big it becomes. 'Perhaps we have slowly had to educate some of the media. One of the things that has kept football down a bit is that some of the high profile media haven't known the sport, and maybe some people are scared of it. They guard their own sports quite carefully.' Heath's Stateside adventure began in the unlikely setting of a pub in his native Newcastle Under Lyme, where he bumped into Stoke City director Phil Rawlins. Kaka is playing out the final days of a distinguished career on the doorstep of Disney World . 'He was looking to invest in soccer over here and I had just lost my job at Coventry. I'd been with Coventry to Portland that year for a pre-season friendly and there were 15,000 people there. I thought the game was taking off and so I thought I'd try and get in early. 'I started off at the bottom in the USL in Austin, Texas. Sometimes there were less than 1,000 people in the ground, not great facilities, lot of college kids, but you could see the game growing. 'Now you look at Seattle Sounders and they would be not that far from Man United and Arsenal in average gates, getting 45,000 per game.' His belief that in ten years the MLS will be world's 'third or fourth biggest league' is fuelled by his daily influx of emails: ' I only have to open my inbox every day to see how many people want to come out here. All the time agents are offering me players who are going to be out of contract in two years' time, big international players who will may be be 29 then.' Orlando midfielder Kaka has the highest salary in MLS history . While Beckham is still looking for a ground in Miami \u2013 last month he made an unusually low profile visit in further efforts to resolve the issue \u2013 Orlando sold out their opening game last month at the temporary home of the Citrus Bowl. 'We got 62,000 our first game. That will not be sustained but we are building a 21,000 seater stadium with the capability of going up to 28,000 and we will fill that.' It helps having Kaka as the club's marquee signing, a superstar in name but evidently not in behaviour, as Heath quickly discovered: 'We went on pre-season to Charleston and we hired a few vans to transport everyone around. He volunteered to drive one of them and then would wait around for the kids who are straggling and the last to leave, to make sure they're not left behind. He's a remarkable person.' He knows what an impact the involvement of Beckham could also have if he can sort problems out 250 miles south, and admits a vested interest:' I think he has faced an uphill battle on the back of what happened with the baseball there. The city invested millions into the Marlins and they weren't happy with how it worked out with the owner. Midfielder Heath scored 71 goals in 226 games for Everton . 'There's nobody at this club that doesn't want to see David get it off the ground in Miami. Rivalry makes sports, and we could get that going with Miami and maybe Atlanta, which is also a few hours up the road. ' I think David will do it there, it's very difficult for a city to turn down a major league sport over here with all that it brings. One of things that has helped in Orlando is that it's a young city and they want to show it has a lot more to offer than Disney. The city has united behind this.' Gerrard and Lampard will be coming sooner and, he says, there will be a few culture shocks. ' They will have to get used to the travel for an away game. Six hour flights leaving on Thursday and not arriving back until Sunday night. The time difference, sleep patterns. 'I think they'll be impressed with the athleticism in the league. Six years ago coming here in your mid thirties you could get away with coasting but those days are gone. Frank will be fine and so will Steven because they've got great football brains.' Heath helped Everton lift eight trophies during his six years at Goodison Park . And they will find a much more level playing field.'The great thing about the MLS is because of the salary cap there is parity and you don't know who is going to win the league. The Premier League is exciting in many ways but you know only three or four teams can win it. ' Nobody is more patriotic than me and I'm very proud to have played for the likes of Everton and Man City. But the thought that Everton might never win another trophy doesn't sit well with me. They were level five years ago with Man City. It's unthinkable that Everton might not win anything again.' Heath is that rare bird in English football, the traveller, having also spent a season at Espanyol as a player. It has made him a better coach, although he admits his Spanish excursion was not about self-improvement. 'I earned more money going to Spain, one of the reasons we don't export any more from England is that we are the gravy train. If you want to earn a lot of money you stay in England. If you go back to the likes of me, Mark Hateley, Glenn Hoddle, Michael Robinson, the truth is we all went for more money. But it does help you learn.' Now he is doing something very unusual, having to effectively build a team from scratch after Orlando's 'promotion', working all the time within the salary cap. They currently lie third in the Eastern Conference after six games. 'The bottom line is we have got just under 4 million pounds to work with for 28 players (one of them is his son Harrison). You get three of them outside the wage cap but they count as 400 each against it so there is a lot of juggling.' Heath never gets homesick, and there is a constant flow of football people passing through from England, usually taking their children to Disneyland. 'The funny thing is that is brought my kids over quite a few times when I was a player and they were younger, but now I'm working here I've never set foot in the place.'", "answer": "Former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Adrian Heath is now manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City .\nThe 53-year-old has been has been in the United States for eight years and witnessed the boom of 'soccer'\nHeath says Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are in for a few culture shocks when they join the MLS revolution .", "completion": ["Adrian Heath, manager of the newest MLS team Orlando City, discusses the growth of soccer in the US, the potential of the MLS becoming the world's 'third or fourth biggest league' in ten years, and the challenges of building a team from scratch while working within the salary cap."]}

She follows a host of other celebrities to back Pacquiao, including The Fighter star Mark Wahlberg, NFL quarterback Tim Teebow, basketball legend Robert Jaworski and actor Robert Duvall who have met with the boxer at his camp.

{"input": "As Patrick Bamford fired home his 19th Middlesbrough goal of the season on Tuesday night, there was one question on everybody\u2019s lips: can he make the grade at Chelsea next season? The 21-year-old striker has been prolific in his loan spells at Boro, Derby and MK Dons, so much so that Sportsmail understands his parent club are opening talks with him over a new deal. Needless to say it would see his wages rise from his current \u00a37,500-a-week deal. He will also be given the chance to impress Jose Mourinho on Chelsea\u2019s summer tour although at the end of it he is expected to go out on loan again. This time, though, Bamford will be sent to a Premier League club, preferably Aitor Karanka\u2019s Middlesbrough should they join the Blues in the top flight. Scroll down for video . Patrcik Bamford (centre) scored in Middlesbrough's  their 2-1 Championship win over Wolves on Tuesday . Bamford reels away in celebration after netting his 19th goal of the season in all competitions for Boro . The 21-year-old's (centre) sparkling form has led his parent club Chelsea to open talks over a new deal . The worry is that it is the same tactic the club employed with Romelu Lukaku, who was eventually sold to Everton. But Bamford is a confident young man and will believe he can emulate Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane and force Chelsea\u2019s hand. Bamford is currently one of 26 players out on loan from Stamford Bridge - five of which are rival frontmen - while academy forwards Dominic Solanke and Isaiah Brown have already won elevation to the senior set-up. Then there are Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba already competing for that sole striking role. The chances of Bamford making his mark next season, you feel, are slim. But then weren\u2019t the chances of Kane scoring 29 goals for Spurs in his breakthrough season and then netting on his full England debut also outlandish? Bamford has already impressed Mourinho with his attitude. The striker was sat with his dad and Chelsea\u2019s technical director two years ago when the manager walked in and boldly demanded of the youngster, \u2018What do you want?\u2019 He was encouraged by the reply. \u2018To play for Chelsea,\u2019 returned the well-mannered but equally brazen rookie. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) has been impressed with Bamford's attitude as well as his development . Romelu Lukaku (pictured in 2011) was sold to Everton in the summer after failing to make the grade . Chelsea youth product Dominic Solanke (centre) has won elevation to the first-team squad this season . Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) has scored 29 goals in his breakthrough season for the club . Bamford has always achieved his goals in life - be it straight A grades at Nottingham High School, teaching himself Spanish and to play guitar or, indeed, scoring goals as a footballer. He left Mourinho in no doubt as to his ultimate ambition. Last summer, when Mourinho convinced Bamford that Middlesbrough was the best place for him, the manager dispensed with his cool exterior and hugged his player. \u2018He was very emotional,\u2019 recalls the 21-year-old. And there is the ace which Bamford holds - Mourinho likes him. In June he will line up alongside Spurs\u2019 Kane for England at the Under 21 European Championships. Kane is just six weeks older and has plotted a similar path through the Football League. On Tuesday night he became Boro\u2019s first player since 1990 to score 17 league goals in one season. The play-offs are Boro\u2019s most likely destination. But for Bamford - favourite to land the Football League\u2019s Young Player of the Year prize - the chance of a showcase match at Wembley is no bad thing. Asked to detail the aspects of his game which have improved this season, Bamford said: \u2018I now know how to use my strength in that position (lone striker), and I can run a lot more.\u2019 If Mourinho was listening it would have been music to his ears. For Bamford\u2019s ability - the raw talent which persuaded Chelsea to prise him from Nottingham Forest as an 18-year-old after only 12 minutes of first-team football - has never been in question. That much was in evidence during the midweek win over Wolves. His goal was a ruthless combination of technique and instinct. At times he reminds you of a young Teddy Sheringham, but with more pace. But more eye-catching was the selfless pursuit of a hopeful punt forward when, after out-muscling and out-pacing his minders, he squared for a team-mate to score. There is, then, graft as well as craft. Silk allied to steel. But it is Bamford\u2019s personality which is most endearing. Bamford scored in Middlesbrough's surprise FA Cup fourth round win at Manchester City on January 24 . The striker's style of play has been compared to ex-England and Tottenham forward Teddy Sheringham (left) After training every day he goes home and practises guitar for \u2018one hour only\u2019 because he doesn\u2019t want to \u2018p*** off the neighbours\u2019. He already plays piano, violin and saxophone and is conversational in German as well as French. There was an offer from Harvard University to study economics, and he could even have followed his two sisters down a medicine and science route. He shunned all of that, however, for a career in football. Bamford knows what he wants, and so does Mourinho. He feels he is ready to make the grade at Chelsea. To do that, like Kane, he first needs the chance.

Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\u2019 t want them to have any more.'

The manner of the late leveller was a real kick in the teeth for Bournemouth after they had bounced back from Kieran Lee's opener and had then taken the lead despite having 10 men following Simon Francis' second yellow card. But their promotion hopes remain in their own hands and they know victory over Bolton live on TV and at Charlton on the final day will see them reach the top flight for the first time in their history. 'That really is tough to take,' Howe added. 'That is the reason why we love the game, with its drama and twists and turns even in one game. It was a heartbreaking end to the game for us. 'Even though we have had the most successful season in the club's history, we have had many moments when we have felt low and down and we have to respond to adversity. 'We only have two games to go now and again our objective is very clear. If we do that then we will be where we want to be.' Gray was heartened with Wednesday's fighting spirit even though there was nothing on the line with safety secured.

{"input": "His voice cracked with emotion at times and in the next breath he laughed at questions and joked with his boss, Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc. In short, Jurgen Klopp\u2019s farewell press conference was much like his seven years at the club: engaging, compelling and infused with passion. Klopp is leaving Borussia Dortmund after seven seasons in which he has won two Bundesliga titles, the German Cup and reached the Champions League final, in 2013 at Wembley. Wednesday was not quite \u2018auf wiedersehen\u2019 as there are eight more matches of the season to play. Manager Jurgen Klopp announced he would be leaving Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, Klopp and Michael Zorc  of Dortmund were present for the press conference at Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday . Photographers snap away at Klopp as journalists gather during the announcement of his Dortmund exit . Yet an era is coming to an end and not just at Dortmund, but \u2013 and this is tribute to the charisma he has evoked during his time there \u2013 in European football. Like Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, Klopp has elevated himself into the realms of the cult manager. He is distinct in that he is much more open than Guardiola and seemingly much less calculating than Mourinho, though that in itself is, of course, a calculation. Though there is much more to Dortmund than just Klopp, at times it seems that it has been his sheer force of personality which has carried the club. Klopp was emotionally charged during the press conference as he couldn't resist showing his sadness . But Klopp also had moments where he laughed along with his boss Zorc during the press conference . Borussia Dortmund celebrate in front of their fans after winning a league match against Hamburg in 2011 . There are many reasons why Dortmund have captured the imagination of fans across the world and especially in England: there is the extraordinary atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion and the 82,000 fans; there are the season tickets available at \u00a3160; the membership structure which allows fans a say in the running of the club; the little ritual at the end of the game where the players gather in he centre circle, join hands and thank the fans. They came to represent everything the Premier League isn\u2019t. BORUSSIA DORTMUND: . German league champions: 2010-11, 2011-12 . German cup: 2012 . Champions League runners-up: 2012-13 . INDIVIDUAL: . German manager of the year: 2011, 2012 . FIFA coach of the year runner-up: 2013 . And then there were the players, like Marco Reus, Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Mats Hummels, electrifying the Champions League with their energy and verve. But it was Klopp who was the public face of a club, the embodiment of all that. He was a journeyman football from Mainz, a second-rate lower league team when he played for them. Only when he managed them did they become a Bundesliga force, qualifying for the UEFA Cup, a track record which eventually earned him the Dortmund job. The club was emerging from bankruptcy when he arrived and he has helped to transformed them into one of Europe\u2019s elite football institutions. And whenever they have lost key players \u2013 Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Gotze, Lewandowski \u2013 it seemed to make no difference. The team just took stock and rolled on. It seemed Klopp alone could keep driving the model ever upwards and onwards. Except this season the momentum ground to a halt. In February they were bottom of the Bundesliga and relegation loomed. They have recovered and are tenth but were dumped out of the Champions League by Juventus. Klopp claimed today that he is not tired and that he doesn\u2019t require a sabbatical. But it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the pressure of trying to keep up with Bayern as they cherry picked his best players had finally proved too much. Klopp (left) stands alongside Hansa Rostock boss Juri Schlunz during his days as Mainz manager, where he built the foundations of his reputation after guiding them into the UEFA Cup . After winning the Bundesliga in 2011, Klopp celebrates with Dortmund fans as he holds the trophy . But Klopp would fall one step short in winning the Champions League as his Dortmund team lost to Bayern Munich in the 2013 final at Wembley. Here he stands with Kevin Grosskreutz following the loss . \u2018This wasn\u2019t a calculated decision, it wasn\u2019t planned it\u2019s not tactical,\u2019 said Klopp. \u2018It\u2019s just that I simply believe that it\u2019s right and important that we can announce this today so we can be up front and begin to make a logical plan to bring this to an end.\u2019 There is another side to Klopp, of course. He could match Mourinho for haranguing referees and has been known to go into full tantrum mode on the touchline. And his stylised open-ness isn\u2019t for everyone. He met with Manchester City officials when the club were considering replacements for Roberto Mancini; they opted for Manuel Pellegrini. It will be interesting to see whether City will now give Klopp a second chance. Klopp has in the past been linked with taking over from Arsene Wenger (right) at Arsenal as the duo shake hands before a Champions League tie at the Emirates Stadium last November . As he barks instructions from the touchline, Klopp's emotional grasp of the game makes him ideal for the Premier League. The Dortmund boss shows his fury after his side fall behind against Stuttgart in September . Arsene Wenger was less than amused when he compared Arsenal to an orchestra playing a \u2018silent song,\u2019 adding: \u2018I prefer heavy metal.\u2019 It came at a time when Wenger was under pressure, an older man who seemed to be struggling to keep up with the new wave; Klopp knew how to make the point. In many ways he does seem made for the Premier League. His capacity to embrace a club emotionally makes him the thinking man\u2019s Ian Holloway. The sheer relentlessness of his teams and their work-rate means he would have no problem passing the Premier League\u2019s \u2018foreigner test\u2019 otherwise known as wet, windy night at Stoke. \u2018What I love is fighting football,\u2019 Klopp once said, explaining that in Germany they even call this \u2018English\u2019 football. \u2018Rainy day, heavy pitch, everybody is dirty in the face. This is Borussia.\u2019 It is Klopp\u2019s mantra too. He clearly won\u2019t lack for offers.

Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons . Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over. The pair seemed to exchange words and former NRL star Tong responded by appearing to headbutt Cudjoe right in front of referee Robert Hicks. Tong was sin-binned and Cudjoe got a verbal warning in the presence of Giants skipper Brough. Huddersfield took full advantage of the extra man by running in two quick tries, first from Ta'ai a minute later and then Scott Grix on 65 minutes. There was no further score, but Louis Anderson lost his temper late on as Huddersfield defensively shut the game down.", "answer": "Aaron Murphy scored twice as Huddersfield ended three-match losing run .\nFormer Wakefield Wildcats star has now scored six tries in his last five .\nMurphy\u00a0went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass .\nHe was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai off-loaded kick from Danny Brough .", "completion": ["Huddersfield secured a 38-14 Super League victory against Catalans Dragons, ending a three-match losing streak, with winger Aaron Murphy scoring twice in the seven-try game."]}

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League.

Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. \u2018I can understand why fans are frustrated,\u2019 said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. \u2018It\u2019s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there\u2019s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they\u2019ve been.

Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books - he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it.

It's what I always wanted to do and I've been touted as a champion for years and if I never got it I would have been disappointed. Now the monkey is off my back and I can just box and show people who I am. 'We've made physical and tactical improvements in the gym since the last fight and hopefully they'll show up in the ring on Saturday. 'I think this could be a technical fight or it could be a bit of a fire fight. It's going to be a little of both at times. There will be moments where we're looking at each other, figuring each other out, but once we exchange it could be explosive. 'Quillin is sure of himself, but he has to be, I have the same mentality. You have to be to compete in this sport. 'Fighting at home like Quillin is on Saturday, brings a different kind of pressure to the table, it's the pressure of expectations and people you know coming to the fights.

'I never trailed in a fight and came back and won like Lee. I've just won all the time right out of the gate. Those other guys aren't 'Kid Chocolate' so I think that's why this fight was made,' he said. 'It's a big fight for him and a big fight for me. He's a smart fighter when he's in trouble so I have to watch out for that. Most importantly I just need to be true to myself. 'A lot of people had Lee as the underdog in his last fight but he came out and did great. That's the thing about boxing; one punch can change the fight.

Sean Reardon was stopped by police as he drove through Chico in California and claims once he was out of the car he was wrestled to the floor by two police officers who then hit him with a baton or stick. Video footage of the incident, taken by a bystander, has emerged and shows the 30-year-old being repeatedly hit by an officer as he lay on the road. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged which shows a man being beaten as he lays on the floor after being pulled over by police . The clip, posted by\u00a0Action News Now, shows Reardon appearing to be hit with force multiple times. It is likely to inflame tensions in America about police brutality after a number of high profile incidents of beatings and fatal shootings have been caught on camera. Reardon claims he was subjected to violence 'without provocation' and suffered acute respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator in hospital. He was in ICU for 4 days. He says he also suffered multiple broken bones, including ribs, nose and sternum. Reardon told TMZ that after he got out of his Chevy Suburban near 5th and Main Streets in Chico, he was tackled to the floor and 'hog tied'. He said he was then thrown into the back of a van by police before being taken to hospital after the incident on February 18, at about 9.40pm. Officers claim Reardon had failed to appear at court on gun charges and refused to raise his hands after being stopped. They said he then attempted to flee when pulled over. In the footage an officer is shown repeatedly hitting Reardon with an object as he lay on the ground . Butte County Chief deputy District Attorney claimed the officers used force to restrain Reardon. He was said to be almost twice over the legal limit for driving and had traces of methamphetamine and cocaine in his blood. Reardon had allegedly hit two cars while trying to get away from the officers, KRCRtv reported. After he hit a parked car he is said to have got out of the vehicle and approached an officer, before complying with orders to lie on the ground. Reardon has denied charges of\u00a0evading a peace officer, DUI, DUI with alcohol or drugs within 10 years of a prior, and resisting an executive officer . He has not been granted bail. Reardon is on the floor as one of the officers crouches down beside him and the other gets ready to hit him . The 30-year-old claims he was left with broken bones and ribs after being subjected to the brutal beating . The video footage has emerged as tensions over police brutality have increased in America following a number of shootings and incidences of violence caught on camera in recent weeks. This week helicopter cameras captured police beating Francis Pusok at least 80 times after they had already tasered him. Police had tried to arrest him at his southern California and he fled on a horse - sparking a two hour chase before he fell off and was beaten. Last week footage emerged of unarmed black man Derek Harris, 44, being shot dead by a 74-year-old reserve deputy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He claimed he had accidentally mistaken his hand gun for his taser and had not intended to kill Mr Harris, who was being chased by police following a sting operation. Walter Scott was shot in the back as he attempted to flee police, after being pulled over for a broken tail light . Officers were seen surrounding\u00a0Francis Pusok as he lay on the ground after falling off his horse . Police officer Michael Slager was charged with murder earlier this month after video captured on a mobile phone showed him shooting Walter Scott, a coast guard veteran, in the back as he ran away. Mr Scott had been pulled over for driving with a broken tail light . Evidence of police brutality has caused outrage in America and led to high profile protests. Hundreds of protesters wore 'I can't breathe' t-shirts at a basketball match in Brooklyn in tribute to black father-of-six Eric Garner who died after being held in a fatal chokehold.

The temperature had climbed above 40C for a whole week and even the Aussies were struggling. Appropriately, friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city's hottest restaurants - Celsius! Luckily, it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food. We especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream. But Adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons. It was the cycling mecca of the world, with 20 teams of Lycra-clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars.

Not only was the launch night atmosphere electric, but it was great to catch up with our pals Sir Chris Hoy and Team Sky's Geraint Thomas. We also rubbed shoulders with the Indian cricket team. Howzat! We were staying at the Adina Apartment Hotel, the former Treasury building, where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen. The Beatles hid here to evade fans back in 1964. Breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard, a delightful start to the day. The hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid Central Market. A trip here is enough to convince anyone that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia. And bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour's drive of the city, from the Barossa Valley to McLaren Vale, you feel very indulged. Adelaide is a much softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe. It's not called the City of Roses for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards.

Most beaches are half an hour away, but being creatures of habit, we always head for the Adelaide Hills and the foodie haven of Hahndorf. Here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called The White House. We then do a bit of wine-tasting in the scenic Hills and lovely\u00a0McLaren Vale, arriving at the classy Currant Shed in time for supper. Set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards, this is my husband's favourite restaurant in the world. I've had a thing about cycling the Clare Valley Riesling Trail for some time. Indeed, part of the reason for coming to sunny South Australia was to tick it off my bucket list. So early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of Adelaide, picked up our bikes from Riesling Trail Bike Hire and cycled along a 15-mile-long disused railway, snaking past vineyards and cellar doors. The gradients were gentle, the information boards fascinating and the tongue-tingling rieslings superb. We then treated ourselves to lunch at Skillogalee Winery, sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines. The historic town of Hahndorf, settled by Germans near Adelaide, is a true blue foodie haven . The bright green of the vineyards of McLaren Vale, a popular wine regions close to Adelaide . North of Clare is where the Outback truly begins. And that's where we were heading - to the rugged Flinders Ranges\u00a0mountains. It took three hours to drive to the majestic range, the largest in South Australia. The Flinders have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks, the vegetation, the bouncing kangaroos, all make you feel as if you're a million miles from civilisation. We stayed at\u00a0Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch, from where we did incredible guided walks, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain. If you want to do the Flinders in understated luxury, this is the way to do it. Think cream and wood with cashmere blankets, scenic vistas, 4x4 wildlife trips, wonderful meals and languid cocktails at sunset.

Having travelled on the glorious Ghan from Darwin to Adelaide last year, and enjoyed every magical minute, he was determined to travel on its sister train, the Indian Pacific, from Adelaide to Perth. Frankly, I can't think of any better way of seeing Australia. You are treated like royalty, the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful, baked continent are breathtaking. Two nights of cruising overland in air-conditioned splendour - it worked for me! As did the stop-offs, first at the Outback ghost town of Cook and finally at floodlit Kalgoorlie, the biggest open-cast gold mine in the country. The size and scale of the Super Pit and machinery were mindblowing. The same goes for the Nullarbor Plain which has hardly changed in millions of years. We crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve. We arrived at the Indian Pacific terminal in Perth as fresh as daisies, and drove the three hours to Margaret River without stopping. But this is where we realised we'd made a big mistake. This was our first visit to Western Australia and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice. The unique mining town of Kalgoorlie is  home to Australia's biggest over-cast gold mine . Sister train of the north to south Ghan, the Indian Pacific takes passengers from Adelaide to Perth . From the first step we took on the Cape to Cape Explorer walk with our guide we knew we'd found exactly what we wanted. The landscape spelt out AUSTRALIA. The views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand, dotted with surfers, were postcard-perfect. Behind the beautiful Margaret River coastline, there are mysterious forests and caves. There's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet. And then there are vineyards... In less than 50 years, Margaret River has become one of the world's greatest wine regions, gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Not only are you spoilt for choice for wines, but the food is up there with the best. Stand-out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel Cape Lodge, the special lunch hosted by the owners of Leeuwin Estate\u00a0and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of Aravina Estate. The stunning coastline of the Margaret River, which is also one of the world's great wine regions . A special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of Leeuwin Estate in the revered Margaret River region . And how about sipping world famous Cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine? This is the stuff memories are made of. We fell in love with Margaret River. Our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at Injidup Spa Retreat, a peaceful paradise overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was such a stunning spot, and we were so relaxed after our massages, that we did not want to go out for dinner.

{"input": "Incredible footage has  captured the moment a huge stingray nibbles on a freediver\u2019s head, gliding back and forth over the man\u2019s body gently on the ocean floor. The video shows the incredibly peaceful encounter between the ray and Johnny Debnam, a 29-year-old commercial diver and ocean lover. Mr Debnam was free diving in water four metres deep; holding his breath and diving down to the depths of the ocean on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Johnny Debnam says he felt completely at ease with the stingray, although he was aware of the risks . The commercial diver was free diving four metres beneath the ocean when he had his snuggle with the ray . \u2018I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,\u2019 Johnny Debnam said of the experience . The video shows the swimmer completely motionless in the seagrass, with the enormous 150 kilogram ray rubbing itself back and forward over his body - even nibbling at his head. \u2018I blew all my air out and was totally calm and at his level,\u2019 explained Mr Debnam during a mini documentary produced for his production company Terra Australis TV. Mr Debnam was completely enveloped underneath the stingray, but he remained calm and insists he relished every minute of the wonderful experience. The stingray is a potentially dangerous creature. If provoked it may use its spiky tail \u2013 known as a barb- to spear the victim and inject them with a deadly poison. Tragically, animal activist and Australian icon Steve Irwin was killed after a deadly encounter with a stingray. In September 2006 the creature stabbed him with its barb 'hundreds of times' as he filmed a documentary near Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. However Mr Debnam's relationship with the stingray was incredibly harmonious. He is experienced with marine life and in the video demonstrates his behaviour to be gentle and threatening, and the stingray appears to reward him with some appreciative cuddles! Johnny Debnam did not have any breathing equipment on when he let all his air out and calmly lay still on the ocean floor . The majestic stingray swum over him three times, enveloping him under his body as he glided on top . \u2018Those things are huge. They\u2019re massive and they could really mess you up if they wanted to,\u2019 Debnam said during his Terris Australis TV documentary. \u2018But, they won\u2019t if they don\u2019t want to.\u2019 Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds. Debnam is ecstatic after his snuggled with the majestic, friendly creature. \u2018I was totally at peace. I loved that thing going over the top of me,\u2019 he said. \u2018It was awesome! It did it three times and I wanted it to do it again. \u2018It was a bit of a rush really!\u2019 Responding to his calm nature, the curious stingray repeatedly glides over him, as if to try to determine what exactly it had found nestled amongst the reeds . The production company he co-created, Terra Australis TV, specialises in creating stunning cinematography of the incredible creatures beneath the ocean\u2019s surface in Western Australia. Debnam and his cameraman Cameron Wallace are passionate about showing the ocean respect whilst exploring and filming the wonders of the sea. \u2018That\u2019s what makes you feel alive.

{"input": "Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona to just two points at the top of La Liga, but will be praying injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric don't derail their season. Both Los Blancos stars were substituted as Carlo Ancelotti's side struggled to overcome a spirited Malaga, who had chances to snatch a draw. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty but provided goals for Sergio Ramos and James Rodriguez, before adding the third himself, as Madrid kept within touching distance of league leaders Barcelona.

Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous \"BBC\" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu . The Welsh forward was forced to go off to be replaced in the early stages of proceedings . Ramos tucks the ball in to open the scoring for Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . The defender slides on his knees in front of the Real Madrid fans after netting . Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break. Ronaldo saw his second-half penalty hit the post after Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni had gone the right way . Real Madrid forward Ronaldo looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half . But Rodriguez soon doubled Real Madrid's lead just a couple of minutes after Ronaldo had missed the penalty . Ronaldo celebrates after securing the 3-1 victory late on after Malaga had pulled one back . Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game.

{"input": "It is exactly a year since Sportsmail revealed that David Moyes was getting the sack at Manchester United, the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at Everton meant Champions League qualification was no longer possible. Into his shoes stepped an entirely different character, the supremely confident Louis van Gaal. One year on, JOE BERNSTEIN looks at which man has coped best in the crucial areas of the job, with the pressure of trying to continue Sir Alex Ferguson's success at Old Trafford weighing heavily. David Moyes waved goodbye to Manchester United exactly a year ago after a dismal run of results . Louis van Gaal has propelled United back into the top four, despite an up-and-down season . RESULTS . For David Moyes to take a team that had won the Premier League title by 11 points into seventh place was an unmitigated disaster, even if he coped well with his first Champions League campaign and reached the quarter-finals. United lost seven of their 19 league games at Old Trafford \u2013 unacceptable. Under Louis van Gaal, United have already won more league points than they did last season and there are still five matches left. There has been the occasional blip, like losing twice to Swansea City, but the bigger the match, they better they've done, which is how United are meant to be. Two results stand out in particular. Under Moyes, United lost 3-0 at home to their biggest rivals Liverpool and Manchester City. In the corresponding fixtures this season, they have won 3-0 and 4-2. Moyes 4/10;\u00a0Van Gaal 7/10 . United reflect on another low point last season after Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich . There is a different vibe around Old Trafford now, as seen in the 4-1 win over Manchester City this month . PERFORMANCES . Neither manager plays the same way as Ferguson, whose response when lesser teams came to Old Trafford was to try and overwhelm them with attacking play, based on the use of wingers. Moyes is a more cautious manager, prioritising his defence and it left United fans chanting: 'Come on David Moyes, play like Fergie's boys'. Van Gaal has also been criticised for building play too slowly, he likes to keep possession as a tool for eventually killing off the opposition, death by a thousand passes. But funnily enough that criticism has subsided as the results have improved. Under Moyes, United looked great in some away games, particularly hitting Newcastle for four at St James' Park. But they fell short in the big matches. United got lucky at Arsenal and Southampton earlier in the season, but the showing in the Manchester derby a fortnight ago was a lot more vibrant. Moyes 5/10;\u00a0Van Gaal 6/10 . Juan Mata scored twice as United enjoyed a 4-0 win at Newcastle, a rare good show under Moyes . Robin van Persie's double helped United scrape a lucky win at Southampton in December . DECISIONS . David Moyes got himself into a pickle before he'd even started by appearing ambiguous over whether he was a Robin van Persie man or a Wayne Rooney man. The result was the pair failed to link up in any meaningful way. Having spent \u00a327million on Marouane Fellaini, he deployed him too deep, and failed to get the best out of experienced players Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs. Van Gaal comes across as a man who knows what he wants but a defensive injury crisis early on seemed to make him lurch from one formation to another. Rooney was also shunted around from attack to midfield which didn't get the best out of him. Ironically, it was Van Gaal's decision to push a Moyes signing, Fellaini, forward which proved the key to turning United's season around. Moyes and Van Gaal have both made mistakes but the Dutchman seems to have the strength of personality to correct them in time. He has left big names out like Angel di Maria, Falcao and Robin van Persie. Moyes didn't seem to have the confidence to do that. Making Rooney captain was a Van Gaal plan that has worked. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . Ryan Giggs (left) was one of the senior pros whom Moyes failed to get the best out of . Falcao has been a big disappointment under Van Gaal, but the United boss hasn't been afraid to drop him . SIGNINGS . It's a confusing area because we don't really know who has been responsible for all the signings at United since Ferguson left. One can assume Moyes handpicked Fellaini from Everton and he has been a belated success, but the \u00a337.1million acquisition of Mata looked more like opportunism from Ed Woodward who needed at the time to know he could pull off a big deal. Ander Herrera, signed when Van Gaal was in charge, is regarded more as a Moyes buy - he'd done the homework on the Spaniard. Likewise, Van Gaal can take credit for Daley Blind, whose versatility has come in useful this season, and Marcos Rojo. He admits he had little to do with Herrera or Luke Shaw, and the capture of Falcao was probably driven at boardroom level. The biggest signing, \u00a360million for Di Maria, is interesting. Van Gaal definitely liked him as a winger but the Argentine has been a letdown despite 10 Premier League assists. Moyes definitely scores a higher mark now for his transfer business than he would have scored when he left the club, which is why his supporters are aggrieved he wasn't given a second season. Moyes 6/10; Van Gaal 5/10 . Marouane Fellaini was originally branded a poor signing but Moyes's decision has since been vindicated . Angel di Maria was bought for a British record \u00a360m, but has flopped in his first season at United . RELATIONSHIP WITH PLAYERS . Having worked with Wayne Rooney as a teenager at Everton, Moyes was able to get the striker back onside despite his disappointment at the time of not earning a move to Chelsea. But other senior professionals did not react well to the Scot. Robin van Persie felt he was over-trained, though he was careful not to publicly criticise Moyes, but others like Rio Ferdinand were not shy about voicing complaints over issues like when the team was announced. Ryan Giggs made it clear he preferred a more direct, attacking approach with 'pace and width'. Club captain Nemanja Vidic made his decision to leave during Moyes' tenure. It is hard to know exactly what goes on in the inner sanctum but it does appear Van Gaal is highly respected by his United squad. The attention to detail in training has won over key players like Rooney and Michael Carrick, the midfielder even suggesting the team's new style has been taken on board by the players quicker than the fans have done. Even when the team was struggling, you haven't heard mumblings of discontent in the dressing-room compared to a year ago. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . Moyes endured a fractious relationship with several stars at United, including Van Persie . Wayne Rooney and Van Gaal have formed a strong bond, and the Dutchman has the respect of his squad . PUBLIC RELATIONS . In a sense, Moyes was handed a thankless task, replacing Ferguson as the 'Chosen One'. It did require a strong personality with a thick skin, and unfortunately the Scot failed on both counts. In retrospect, he was too deferential, when he cited the club's tradition for bringing in young players and attacking until the end, it didn't sound right because his strengths lie elsewhere. His admission that he didn't take Van Persie off because he feared the reaction smelt of weakness. Neither was he helped by criticism from club legends Paul Scholes and Gary Neville on television. Because of his c.v., Van Gaal has been able to lay down his markers rather better. He has dealt with the likes of Patrick Kluivert, Xavi and Andres Iniesta and the fans of Bayern Munich and Barcelona so nothing at United was going to frighten him. He has been confident enough to lay down his philosophy, whether popular or unpopular. His biggest error was getting sucked into an argument over long-ball tactics with Sam Allardyce. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . A banner critical of manager Moyes was flown above Old Trafford during a match against Aston Villa . Van Gaal's glittering CV ensured he had the gravitas needed to take on one of the game's biggest jobs . ESCAPING THE SHADOW OF FERGIE . Having personally anointed Moyes, Ferguson maybe felt subconsciously he should have some influence. He went to nearly all the matches despite having said on retirement he'd travel the world and was put out that Moyes let his backroom team of Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen leave. Certainly, when Moyes was heading out, Fergie knew about it and didn't fight to keep him. Ferguson knows he won't hold any sway over Van Gaal and doesn't even try, which has helped the Dutchman. He rarely goes to games now, and when he does he's definitely regarded as a legendary former manager rather than a backseat driver. Whether he intended to or not, Ferguson's shadow loomed large over Moyes. It's an issue Van Gaal has not had to contend with apart from the fans chanting 'Attack, attack, attack' when the ball is passed back to David de Gea. Moyes 4/10; Van Gaal 6/10 .

The effects of nitrous oxide vary depending on how much has been inhaled but they include: . \u2022 Feelings of euphoria, relaxation and calmness. \u2022 Dizziness, difficulty in thinking straight and fits of giggles/laughter. \u2022 Sound distortions or even hallucinations. \u2022 In some people, a headache can be an unwanted immediate effect. Risks include: . \u2022 Unconsciousness or death from lack of oxygen. This occurs when the available oxygen for breathing is effectively pushed out by the nitrous oxide. A Liverpool spokesman said: \u2018We are aware of the story and intend to speak to the player. Any subsequent action will be taken internally.\u2019 Sportsmail contacted Sterling\u2019s agent, Aidy Ward, last night. He refused to comment on the story but did not deny that it was his client. A small pocket of Liverpool fans on The Kop vented their frustrations at last night\u2019s game, chanting \u2018Raheem Sterling, your agent\u2019s a k***\u2019 during the first half. They were widely applauded. Asked if he will be reminding Sterling of his responsibilities, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: \u2018I will do. He\u2019s a young kid who has been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class professional \u2014 it\u2019s not just on the field it\u2019s off the field, but I will speak with him on it and we\u2019ll move on.\u2019 Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool captain Jamie Carragher said: \u2018In years to come he\u2019ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve. When you\u2019re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes. I did, I\u2019m sure we all do. It\u2019s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that\u2019s a problem for him in these last few months.\u2019 Players' union chief Bobby Barnes called for understanding after Sterling 'made a mistake'. Barnes, deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association and European president of the international players' union FIFPro, said people should not be too hard on Sterling. He said: 'Nobody would condone the use of these types of substances whether legal or otherwise as footballers are seen as role models. It does send a message to young people that if it's good enough for footballers then it's good enough for them and that is not desirable. The 20-year-old recently snubbed a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer from the Merseyside club . 'But you have to bear in mind that we ask an awful lot of young players growing up in the public eye. Many of us look back at things we have done in our teens and early 20s and wish we hadn't done them. 'He's made a mistake and people are human. I am sure this will be a minor blip on his path to a fantastic career. 'Players have to be aware that there is camera on every corner - they are very much in the spotlight. 'He's a young man, growing up in public eye and he's made a mistake. Let's not be too hard on the boy. He is under a lot of pressure and people think because he has a lot of talent he's also supposed to have diplomacy and wisdom. 'In the main he's doing a very good job, he's at a good club and has a good manager and I'm sure Brendan will put his arm around him and at the same time make him aware of his responsibilities.' Nitrous oxide has been nicknamed \u2018laughing gas\u2019 due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel. Official figures show 460,000 16-24 years olds took it last year. Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . It has been the cause of 17 deaths since 2006. It costs around \u00a32 to buy and is not illegal to possess \u2014 Sterling is not the first footballer to be caught indulging. Drugs charity Re-Solv has called on the 'role model' player to condemn the use of the drug to deter young supporters from taking risks with their health. The anti-drugs organisation's spokesman, Stephen Ream, told MailOnline: 'It's very disappointing from our point of view. He is a big role model and we hate to see this kind of stuff from someone of his status. 'Players in similar situations in the past have come out and apologised and we hope he does the same. 'Nitrous Oxide is not the most dangerous drug out there but there are deaths attached to it. There are risks and we would urge anyone tempted to take it not to do so.' Tottenham defender Kyle Walker was pictured inhaling a balloon in 2013, while last year Saido Berahino was pictured doing it at the wheel of his Range Rover. In February, Jack Wilshere faced criticism after he was pictured with a shisha pipe on a night out while recovering from ankle surgery. But the Arsenal star, who has previously been pictured smoking cigarettes, was defended by England manager Roy Hodgson who said he'd tried the Middle Eastern pipe himself and did not think it was a problem.

Those ambitions were within eight minutes of being shattered when trailing 1-0 to Wigan in their semi-final 12 months ago, before Mertesacker made amends for giving away an earlier penalty when heading home a late equaliser to force extra-time and a nerve-shredding penalty shoot-out victory that in turn set up a final against Hull, which itself proved just as dramatic as Arsenal came from 2-0 down to lift the trophy. 'It is a good warning to all of us. You need to be focused 100 per cent Reading, so it is going to be a tough one for us,' said the German, who will again lead the team out at Wembley with captain Mikel Arteta still not fit. We suffered a bit last season on that occasion with that pressure, but it was a great experience and hopefully we can manage that a bit better. 'We are on a good level of confidence, but there will be pressure on us because we are super favourites and can we handle that during the game?' Mertesacker added: 'It is going to be Reading's biggest game of the season, so to mentally prepare for that is going to be difficult, not just to match their physicality and mental strength, but to do more, to be on the ball from the start, to show them respect, but no fear for the pressure.

The German continued: 'To go on or to be consistent - that is a tough target, but we push ourselves. 'We want to be able to defend a title and be able to compete at the top which makes us at the moment a good team. We haven't shown that consistently this season because all of a sudden we lost one game [in the Champions League last 16 first leg to Monaco] and in a cup competition you cannot afford that.

Danny Ings (right) is a top target for Manchester United and could be set for a summer move to Old Trafford . United have held talks with Burnley and through a loophole in Premier League regulations are able to agree a fee and pre-contract with the player to ensure a transfer in the summer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers tried to sign the striker in January, but Burnley were intent on keeping him until the end of the campaign. Ings is out of contract in the summer but, due to his age, Burnley would be owed a fee set by a tribunal of around \u00a35million if he joined an English club. However, under Premier League Rule U8 domestic clubs are able to agree terms with the club and player who would then move when their contract expires. Louis van Gaal is a fan of Ings and was impressed with the forwards performance against his side . Ings has become one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. If United are successful they would beat former manager David Moyes, who is keen to bring the 22-year-old to Real Sociedad, to the signing. Tottenham and Manchester City are also interested.

Supporters are planning to boycott today\u2019s game at home to Spurs in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner Mike Ashley. Carver was in the dugout alongside Pardew at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3-0 victory over Cardiff. Pardew was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle boss John Carver is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors . Alan Pardew was in charge of Newcastle from 2010 to January this year, when he left for Crystal Palace . Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, the club's record goal-scorer, also had a brief stint as manager . Newcastle fans are planning to protest against owner Mike Ashley for a perceived lack of ambition .

{"input": "Manchester City bounced back from their recent 4-2 derby defeat by easing to victory against West Ham. An own goal by James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Barclays Premier League strike of the season was enough to give City the three points. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates the players' performances at the Etihad Stadium. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1) JOE HART 6 -\u00a0The England goalkeeper couldn\u2019t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. PABLO ZABALETA\u00a06.5 \u2013 Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge . MARTIN DEMICHELIS\u00a06 \u2013 Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City\u2019s \u00a332million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV\u00a06.5 \u2013 Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD\u00a06 \u2013 Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham . FERNANDO\u00a06.5 \u2013 Didn\u2019t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate\u2019s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS\u00a08 \u2013 Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City\u2019s first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium . YAYA TOURE\u00a07 \u2013 A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City\u2019s second goal. DAVID SILVA\u00a06.5 \u2013 Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 \u2013 The Argentine\u2019s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can\u2019t argue with that.

WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN\u00a06 \u2013 Had little chance with either of City\u2019s goals, particularly Collins\u2019s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON\u00a06 \u2013 One of West Ham\u2019s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS\u00a05 \u2013 Won\u2019t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva \u2013 but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 \u2013 Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 \u2013 After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 \u2013 Had his hands full trying to screen West ham\u2019s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 \u2013 His arm into Silva\u2019s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 \u2013 Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 \u2013 Lost the ball in the build-up to City\u2019s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all. ENNER VALENCIA 6 \u2013 Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham\u2019s best effort with a fine individual run and shot. CARLTON COLE 4.5 \u2013 Was gifted the Hammers\u2019 best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan. Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in February .

In the end, an error from Australian Federici proved so costly, the keeper allowing a low, angled shot from Sanchez to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes. 'It was a difficult game against a well organised, resilient, committed and physically strong Reading team,' Wenger said. 'They really wanted it Reading, they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in. 'In the end, we were a bit lucky because their keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but as well he kept them in the game for long periods.' Wenger added: 'What was missing was a bit of speed of combination and sharpness in the final third maybe, but overall the concentration was there. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . 'I don't think we switched off (for the goal), but after half-time we did not come on with the same intensity. We started to suffer and we paid for that.' Wenger refused to single out Szczesny for blame on the Reading goal. 'I would have to see it again,' he said. 'At first I thought it was not in because it took some time for the referee to give the goal, so I thought 'okay, we escaped'. Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . 'But on slow motion maybe he goes back a bit to save the ball with his feet, then when the ball bounces, it was certainly over the line. 'We will have to analyse it, but the cross should not have come in and after the guy was free, so it was a combination of mistakes.' Wenger said an ankle injury to defender Per Mertesacker 'does not look good', which could make the German defender a doubt for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against leaders Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. The Reading goalkeeper, who had been magnificent until then, left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him . Arsenal reached a record 19th FA Cup final, and will be looking to overtake Manchester United's mark of 11 victories, with five coming under Wenger's tenure. 'Now, let's focus on our next game, we come back here in the final, but we have time to prepare,' Wenger said. 'The final is a 50-50 (game). If we can beat the record we will be very happy. 'Let's hope we have all of our players available and come back in good shape.' Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved . Chelsea look in a strong position to go on and win the title, having defeated United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Wenger said he was unaware of the final result when quizzed on its significance at the post-match press conference. 'I ignore completely what happened. Chelsea won 1-0? The usual,' the Arsenal boss said. 'We will see next week.'", "answer": "Arsenal reached the FA Cup final despite failing to live up to recent form .\nAdam Federici's gaffe was  only difference between the sides at Wembley .\nHe let a soft Alexis Sanchez effort squirm through his grasp in extra time .\nWenger felt Federici kept Reading in the game with numerous top saves .", "completion": ["Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted his team was \"a bit lucky\" after a mistake from Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici led to a 2-1 extra-time victory for Arsenal, securing their place in the FA Cup final."]}

A California county on Tuesday approved paying a $650,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit by a man whose beating by deputies after a horse chase was captured on video. San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said county supervisors approved the settlement with 30-year-old Francis Pusok in a closed meeting. Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and has led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe. Wert says the agreement would settle all potential claims from Pusok's April 9 arrest. A message seeking comment was left for Pusok's lawyer. In an interview with NBC 4,  Pusok revealed that he had been handcuffed for '99 per cent' of the beating and that near the end of the scarring experience a deputy whispered into his ear: 'This isn't over.' When San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies arrived at Pusok's house, he said he  fled 'because any contact with police has been negative for me'. As the chase was coming to a close about two and a half hours later, video shows Pusok falling to the ground as he is hit with a taser and two deputies approach.

Pusok's arrest was recorded by a TV news helicopter and led to an FBI civil rights investigation and 10 deputies being placed on leave pending an internal probe . The officers then start to assault Pusok, and later claimed that his taser had been ineffective due to his loose clothing - even though Pusok is clearly seen convulsing from the electric shock in the helicopter footage. Pusok estimates that within 15 seconds of the first taser hit, the cops had him in handcuffs but says they continued to assault him and yelled 'stop resisting' even though he was laying face down on the ground. He says the officers went on to tase him two more times after he was in handcuffs. Pusok remembers the cops 'hitting me every place that they could hit me - anywhere and everywhere.' 'I thought I was being beaten to death,' said Pusok.. 'I was wondering, \"When is it going to stop?\"' After the incident, Pusok was arrested on suspicion of evading, stolen property, reckless driving and theft of a horse. He was treated for his injuries while being held at West Valley Detention Center where he was released Sunday night at bail. A court hearing has been scheduled for June 16, but San Bernardino County Prosecutors said Monday that they had not yet made a decision on whether to file formal charges against Pusok. Meanwhile, 10 officers - including a sergeant and a detective - involved in the incident were placed on paid leave as the FBI starts an investigation into whether excessive force was used in the arrest. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said last week that he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video and that an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. In his interview on Monday, Pusok said he thinks his prior run-ins with police may have sparked their violent backlash. Indeed, Pusok's lengthy criminal record includes charges of obstructing an officer and resisting an officer, as well as attempted robbery, animal cruelty and fighting or offensive words. San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon told reporters he was 'disturbed and troubled' by the video . Deputies have been\u00a0called\u00a0to Pusok's home before, during which he threatened to kill a deputy and shot a\u00a0puppy in front of his family, Sheriff McMhaon said.

{"input": "Bayern Munich cruised to a 6-1 victory against Champion's League rivals Porto last night. But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto . The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend . And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight . The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit . King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy . The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip\u2026from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis\u00a0told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013 . A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one. 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.", "answer": "Spanish football manager tore the side of his trousers exposing his thigh .\nGuardiola said later: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match'\nTrend for tight suits has seen Dermot O'Leary and Olly Murs left red-faced .\nFashion blogger says men shouldn't 'stuff themselves' into too-snug suits .", "completion": ["Bayern Munich's manager, Pep Guardiola, split his pants during a match against Porto, sparking a discussion about the current trend for men to wear tight-fitting suits."]}

'If you're a young English boy coming through the system you should want to play for England.' It was part of a St George's Day message from the FA chairman designed to strengthen the bond between England's patron saint and its football team. 'England has the best football team in the British Isles and if England as a football team does well then England is a united country,' Dyke said. 'Football plays a big part in England and should play a big part in St George's Day.' Kane, with 30 goals for Spurs this season and one on his England debut last month, is due to join Tottenham's end-of-season trip Malaysia and Australia. He is scheduled to return at the start of June and, if he is part of Gareth Southgate's U21 squad, he could be away on international duty until the start of July, after which he will need a break and would miss the start of Pochettino's pre-season plans. Kane scored on his senior England debut against\u00a0Lithuania in March, continuing his fine form this term . England, meanwhile, have pulled out of the annual Victory Shield U16 tournament for the home nations in an effort to save an estimated \u00a3120,000 a year.

{"input": "Liverpool are showing interest in Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile. The Italy international has not had the best of times in the Bundesliga following his move from Torino last summer and Dortmund are willing to sell. Immobile fits the profile of player Liverpool want. He has pace and is a busy forward who can chase down the opposition. His goals ratio has dropped at Dortmund but he has still managed nine goals in a troubled season for the team. Ciro Immobile (left) of Dortmund has struggled in Germany and is wanted by Liverpool to boost their attack . Immobile (left) was signed by Jurgen Klopp (centre) from Torino but could be on the move again . Liverpool have made contact with Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc to sound out the figures. Dortmund are expecting further departures with Manchester United keen on Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan while Real Madrid have expressed interest once again in Marco Reus. Liverpool are also continuing to check on Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia but their lack of Champions League football could prove crucial in their pursuit of certain players as well as their budget. Arsenal have also considered reviving interest in France international Kondogbia. Arsene Wenger enquired after the 22-year-old while he was at Sevilla. Geoffrey Kondogbia (left) of Monaco is also wanted by Liverpool and Arsenal have a long standing interest . Spartak Moscow want to rescue Nemanja Vidic from his nightmare spell at Inter Milan. The former Manchester United captain, now 33, has failed to settle under Roberto Mancini and has been criticised for some of his performances. Spartak have reportedly offered a one year deal worth around \u00a335,000 a week but Vidic wants two years if he leaves Italy. Vidic played for Spartak between 2004 and 2006. Nemanja Vidic (right) has struggled since moving to Italy with Inter Milan and is attracting interest in Russia . Tottenham sent a scout to watch Lille against Bordeaux last weekend where Lille won 2-0 and midfielders Sofiane Boufal and Idrissa Gueye impressed. Tottenham were also represented last week as Club Brugge played out a 0-0 draw with Dnipro in the Europa League. Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka was understood to be the object of Tottenham's attentions with Chelsea and West Ham also represented at the game. Chelsea have checked on Standard Liege left-back Damien Dussaut. The 20-year-old Frenchman has only started five games in the Belgian league this season but is seen as a bright prospect. Paris Saint Germain remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with Liverpool looking unlikely to match the financial package required to prise him out of Stamford Bridge. PSG also like Tottenham's Hugo Lloris but Daniel Levy is no mood to sell the France goalkeeper. Damien Dussaut (left) has impressed for Standard Liege despite only starting five games this season . Manchester City are considering the merits of QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The 25-year-old has had to take a back seat this season while in-form Robert Green held down the No 1 spot. However, the England U21 international is still recognised as one of the more talented English keepers in the country and has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton over the past year. Alex McCarthy (centre) has played second fiddle to Rob Green at QPR but could be a target for Man City . He joined QPR from Reading at the end of last August despite Brendan Rodgers making an attempt to take him to Anfield. City need to address their shortage of homegrown players and McCarthy could fit in. Feyenoord, meanwhile, are struggling to finance a transfer for City striker John Guidetti who has been on loan at Celtic. Stoke City are keen on Blackpool teenager Dom Telford. The 18-year-old striker managed to break into the Blackpool first team this season scoring on his home debut against Rotherham in December. Dom Telford (right) of Blackpool has attracted interest from Stoke, who made a bid for the player in January . City manager Mark Hughes made an approach in January which was rejected but has continually sent scouts to monitor his progress and Telford could reject a contract at Bloomfield Road to switch to the Britannia. Hughes is keen to add more quality young players and has already moved for Barcelona's Moha El Mouriachi, 19, and Thibaud Verlinden, 15, of Standard Liege. Blackpool's Mark Waddington, 18, remains a target for Brighton. Fulham and QPR are showing interest in Celtic defender Efe Ambrose. Both London clubs are looking to re-shape their squads in the summer and Ambrose would still fit into their wage structure. The 26-year-old Nigeria international who has 46 caps is ready to leave Celtic and has interest from Premier League sides also but is keen on a move to London. QPR will lose Steven Caulker, Rio Ferdinand, possibly Richard Dunne and expect Nedum Onouha to move on also. Celtic defender Efe Ambrose is ready to leave the club and is wanted by London rivals Fulham and QPR . West Ham have revived interest in Pedro Obiang of Sampdoria as they consider midfield targets. As reported by Sportsmail, West Ham have doubts about a permanent deal for Alex Song with Inter Milan also showing an interest. Roberto Mancini has Song and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool on his back-up list should he fail to sign Yaya Toure from Manchester City. West Ham want more energy in midfield and have considered James McArthur of Crystal Palace but Obiang remains on their radar too. Spanish-born Obiang is a Spain U21 international and began his career with Atletico Madrid. West Ham showed interest last summer and in January.

{"input": "Sir Alex Ferguson, the quiet years. No singular drive, no all-consuming discipline that keeps him on the go from pre-dawn \u2018til the streetlights are burning bright. As this most honoured of sporting knights puts it himself: \u2018I don\u2019t have obsessions now.\u2019 There\u2019s certainly nothing that comes close to football for the famous Fergie, who has instead chosen to spend his retirement devoting himself to any number of causes; at last count, he was associated with a good dozen charities or foundations. And it will surprise no-one to learn that, while doing his bit for UNICEF, Barnardo\u2019s et al, a little of the old firebrand spirit still burns brightly. If you want to build a statue to a Govan radical who led a rent strike and changed more than just her own wee corner of the world, Sir Alex is the man you call. Sir Alex Ferguson watches on from the stands during Manchester United's clash with Chelsea on April 18 . Ferguson, in Glasgow on Thursday to make a \u00a35,000 donation to the Remember Mary Barbour Fund, actually physically writing out a cheque towards a permanent memorial, revealed that his life hasn\u2019t so much slowed down as merely changed gear since he stepped down as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2013. The 73-year-old, who had lived and breathed football since making his senior debut at the age of just 16, was famous not just for the trophies won \u2013 his haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain\u2019s most successful ever manager \u2013 but the hours put in. Raised to believe that hard work was as necessary as breathing, Ferguson\u2019s ability to push players hard was based at least in part on the example he set himself. That work ethic, simply part of his upbringing in Govan, isn\u2019t something he\u2019s let slide just because he no longer has one demanding day job. \u2018What I\u2019m doing is making sure I remain active,\u2019 said Ferguson, looking trim and at ease. \u2018That\u2019s important when you retire, so I\u2019ve got many things on my plate. \u2018It\u2019s funny, though. It\u2019s a different kind of work. Whereas at United I was in at quarter to seven every morning, and be there to tea time every day, that was one constant thing all your life \u2013 I was doing one thing. Ferguson celebrates United's Premier League title victory in May 2013 with Rio Ferdinand . \u2018Now I\u2019m doing different things, which is maybe even more exhausting! There is no one thing, nothing like that. I don\u2019t have obsessions now. I don\u2019t get up at six o\u2019clock in the morning, that\u2019s for sure. I have a long lie now and again.\u2019 Football is no longer the dominant factor in his life, with even questions on the game receiving short shrift, although \u2013 and this wasn\u2019t always the case back in his managerial days - he was very polite in his refusal, answering the one out-of-bounds query by saying: Listen, Aberdeen are doing fantastic. They\u2019 ve got a great manager and I love that club. But I\u2019m here to talk about Mary Barbour. I don\u2019t blame you for asking \u2026\u2019 Wherever Ferguson goes, he takes his native burgh with him, freely attributing a great deal of his sporting success to the lessons he learned either at home, at Harmony Row Boys Club or Govan High. \u2018Your upbringing is important,\u2019 he said yesterday, adding: \u2018I think it\u2019s the foundation of your life. I was fortunate enough to have good parents who did the best they could possibly do for me. \u2018There are many people who have said I came from a poor background. I don\u2019t think people brought up in my time thought they were poor. Ferguson and then Everton boss David Moyes shout instructions from the sideline at Old Trafford in May 2013 . \u2018Talking about the role of the housewife and mother, they made sure the food was always on the table. That was the case with me. \u2018You were always dressed the best way you could possibly be \u2013 and you were taught to be the best you can be. \u2018That came not just from the parents but from teachers at school. That was their role. I don\u2019t think necessarily education is about learning lessons in school. It\u2019s about inspiring you. And I was inspired by many people.\u2019 Ferguson wasn\u2019t taught about Mary Barbour at school, admitting that he\u2019d only come across her tale when looking through a book of historical Glasgow photographs complied by the great Harry Benson. Ferguson's haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily Britain\u2019s most successful ever manager . Barbour famously led rent strikes in Glasgow at the height of the First World War, forcing a change in the law with the introduction of the Rent Restrictions Act. A consistent campaigner throughout her life, she went on to become one of the city\u2019s first female councillors, the first female Bailie and female magistrate. The fund-raising campaign is aimed at building a statue of Barbour, to be erected on Govan Cross, Ferguson explaining his involvement by saying: \u2018There was a connection with Govan, which is what stirred the real interest in me. \u2018There is that great photo of all the housewives in Govan standing outside the close; that rent men was never getting in that close. That registers deeply with me. I\u2019ve looked at that photograph many, many times.

Its owner then proceeds to apply what looks like moisturizing cream, eye-liner, mascara and finally, and perhaps most shockingly, red lipstick. Discussing the clip, Teresa Bullock told Jukin Video: \u2018Angel is an 18-year-old Java Macaque monkey with health issues so she is a little more human than most because she has to have diabetic shots twice daily and a heart pill. \u2018She loves to do anything she watches you do and being pampered is the best part of her day, other than playing with her kitty.

In the video the owner proceeds to apply what looks like moisturising cream, eye-liner, mascara and finally, and perhaps most shockingly, red lipstick . She said: \u2018Macaques live in highly interactive troops of 80 to 100 members, and a young female rhesus monkey stays with her mother and sisters for life. They form \u2018one of the tightest and most complicated social systems in the animal kingdom,\u2019 according to renowned primatologist Frans de Waal. \u2018In captivity, this essential social fabric is ripped apart, and their individual needs and desires \u2013 such as seeking a mate, raising their young, and resolving territorial disputes \u2013 are completely thwarted. \u2018A life indoors without the essential companionship of other monkeys \u2013 to be used as a living doll, no less \u2013 bears no resemblance to a macaque's natural life. PETA's UK director, Mimi Bekhechi, said that videos like this 'often inspire ill-informed people to obtain monkeys as pets' \u2018What's more, many captive primates were torn away from their mothers in the wild shortly after birth, leaving them with lasting psychological scars.\u2019 She concluded by saying that keeping monkeys is also potentially dangerous for humans and that not only are stressed primates known to lash out and attack those who keep them in captivity, they can also transmit disease. Adding: \u2018The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that the risk of herpes B transmission makes macaques in particular unsuitable as pets.\u2019 Claire Turnbull of\u00a0Wild Futures also spoke to MailOnline.

Ramsey has overseen just one victory since he was appointed permanent manager in February but four points from games against Aston Villa and West Brom, and a narrow defeat to Chelsea, have revived hopes of survival. West Ham's Sam Allardyce and Bournemouth's Eddie Howe have both been linked with Ramsey's job in the summer but the former Tottenham coach believes it would be unfair for his future to depend on Rangers avoiding the drop. QPR manager Chris Ramsey is convinced he is the right man to bring long-term success to Loftus Road . 'I wouldn't say I'm expecting the sack (if QPR are relegated) but I've been in the game a long time and you have to be realistic about what generally happens, whether it's fair or not fair,' Ramsey said. 'I'm going to say it would be unfair because I'll be shopping in Lidl instead of Waitrose, I'll have a different shopping basket. 'I have to look at it from my personal point of view. The club have to do the best for their long term and if it's not me, I'd fully support whatever they decided to do. But I think it is me. 'I think the club long-term needs someone like me to have a holistic approach of building the club.' Ramsey worked with Tim Sherwood at Tottenham's academy, nurturing the likes of Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb - all of whom have thrived at White Hart Lane this season. Rangers have hung their survival hopes on experienced, and often expensive, signings but Ramsey believes he can carry out the club's wish for a more joined-up strategy. The 52-year-old is a popular and respected man within the game, with aspirations of getting the full-time job . 'I think the chairman wants to go that way because we need to keep that stability at the club for the long term,' Ramsey said. 'At Tottenham, it took us nearly a decade to get them where they are, where you could churn out player after player after player to have loads more ready to bolster the squad even if they weren't quite ready. 'At the moment we might only have three or four that could bolster the squad. 'In order to get that correct development you need to be patient but if you do get it right you set the club up for a long time.' Reports suggest that Ramsey could link up with friend Tim Sherwood (left) at Aston Villa in the summer . Rangers are two points adrift of safety having played a game more than the three teams above them and Saturday's game at home to West Ham looks crucial given the club's next two fixtures are away to Manchester City and Liverpool. Ramsey, however, insists he is not feeling the pressure. 'I had more sleepless nights at Tottenham,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes it's harder when you're the number two, you want the number one to do so well and you're trying your best to help them. 'At the moment it is just myself and I know exactly what I want. 'The only thing here is the fans are so fantastic, they have travelled away with us and been brilliant, and I've had quite good dialogue with the owners. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has been linked with Ramsey's job in the summer . 'It's not about sleepless nights, it's more trying to make sure the people around the club have well-deserved success.' West Ham have endured a disappointing second half to the campaign, winning just twice since the turn of the year and slipping to 10th in the table. Allardyce, whose contract expires in the summer, is not expected to remain at Upton Park next season but Ramsey issued a warning to Hammers fans. 'Sam made a comment if he was called Allerdici he'd get more plaudits and I agree with him,' Ramsey said. 'He'd be called a fantastic tactician. They were top half of the table for the first half of the season. 'If it was the other way round and they'd only moved into the top half now, they'd say he'd been brilliant. So it's only perception.

{"input": "Virgil van Dijk believed he had sampled the worst refereeing decision of his career the night he landed an early red card against Inter Milan. Events at Hampden on Sunday forced him to revise his opinion. In the aftermath of a contentious Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the Dutchman found sleep elusive. The claims of referee Steven McLean and his five assistants that they failed to see the handball by Inverness player Josh Meekings which denied Celtic a penalty, a red card, possibly even a crack at the Treble, struck many at Parkhead as dubious. So dubious they fired off a letter seeking clarification from the SFA. Celtic centre back\u00a0Virgil van Dijk leaves field following his side's\u00a03-2 to Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi-final . For van Dijk, the collective burst of myopia was remarkable. A greater lapse on a wider scale than the red card he received from Slovakian official Ivan Kruzliak in the last 32 of the Champions League in February; a decision he described at the time as the worst he had experienced. Resting his arms on a table in a Glasgow hotel after being shortlisted for the PFA Scotland player of the year award, the Dutchman said of the Meekings flashpoint: 'Yeah I saw it. I think everybody in the stadium saw everything. It' s very strange that the right decision wasn't made. 'I was maybe near the halfway line. Even in the stands you could see it. It was a miracle that we didn't get the right decision. Van Dijk netted a superb free-kick against Caley Thistle but it wasn't enough to secure victory . 'This decision was terrible. I don't know \u2013 I've experienced some decisions lately. The Inter Milan game, of course, was terrible for my feelings. 'The decision on Sunday wasn't right and everyone can see it. It's terrible when you think about it . 'It was harder on my feelings (than Milan). I put the ref in a position in Milan to give me a red card (following his challenges on Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi) and that's what I have to learn from. 'Sunday's was a clear decision and it wasn't made - and that's a worse feeling.' Wednesday's 2-1 Premiership win over Dundee helped. It carried Celtic another step closer to the title and was recuperative. The presence of two Parkhead players \u2013 van Dijk and Stefan Johansen \u2013 on the PFA Scotland shortlist suggests the season may yet redeem itself. Josh Meekings handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . Van Dijk is clear that punishing the Inverness player would have been futile and pointless. The blame for what happened lies, he believes, with the officials who created the mess and then closed ranks to insist they simply hadn't seen it. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has called on the officials to be held to account. But when SFA the freeze out their officials, it's done behind closed doors, quietly and without ceremony. 'I don't know,' said van Dijk, 'I don't think I can give my opinion on that. I want to move forward as well. We're not in the final. I want to win the league as soon as possible so we need to win on Sunday and move forward. My feeling is you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake.' Ronny Deila described the circumstances of the defeat to Inverness as the worst of his career. The Celtic manager returned home to stare at the walls while, for van Dijk, counting sheep proved an inadequate antidote to insomnia. 'Everybody was very down, especially after the game. For myself personally I was devastated, especially during the night, I couldn't sleep that well. 'That was the biggest chance to get the Treble and everyone at Celtic, and I think around Celtic as well, had the feeling that it was going to happen. 'If the right decision had been made in the game on Sunday we would have been in the final and we would hopefully have won the final. 'The Treble was very close. But it's not going to be turned around any more.' There are five games left now to change perceptions of the season. Celtic expect to win the league. With five games left and an eight-point lead over Aberdeen, they are almost there. Thereafter what transpires between Falkirk and Inverness in the Hampden final on May 30 is a source of utter indifference for the likes of van Dijk. 'I go on holiday so I don't think i will see it,' he said. 'After this season I don't want to watch any football. I've been the whole year watching and playing football and I have to be mentally rested for next season. I don't think I will watch it.' From the comfort of a Dubai lounger, he may give a little more time to his own future. Nominated for a second successive season by PFA Scotland, there are times when the Scottish game looks a little too easy for the 23-year-old defender. For the sake of his own development, there is the expectation he will leave Celtic this summer. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Meekings and award his side a penalty . Parrying questions on the matter, he insisted: 'My thoughts are that I want to win the league as soon as possible. 'We'll see what happens in the summer but for now I'm a Celtic player and we'll see if that is or isn't the case after the summer. 'It's an amazing club and you don't want to leave a club like this for one that is not as big. 'You need to know what you want \u2013 you don't need to lie. You have to be straight. I will be straight with everyone. 'I'm focusing on the present. You never know what will happen but for now I'm enjoying being a Celtic player.' His dilemma is clear. Celtic are a large club in a small league. Asked if a smaller club in a large league like England would be worth leaving for, he said: 'It depends on the club. If Celtic was playing in the Premier league then they would be one of the best clubs in the world and to stay here would be much more interesting than anything else. 'It is what it is right now. I just want to win the league as soon as possible and hopefully get a nice game maybe before we have to go to Aberdeen. Or maybe Aberdeen away will be a nice place to win the championship\u2026'", "answer": "Celtic crashed lost to 3-2 to Inverness in the\u00a0Scottish Cup semi-final .\nThe referee failed to spot a handball from Inverness player Josh Meekings .\nThe decision denied Celtic a penalty during a crucial point of the game .\nVan Dijk was sent off against Inter Milan in the last 32 of the Champions League in February .", "completion": ["Virgil van Dijk, a Dutch footballer, has expressed disappointment over a controversial refereeing decision during a Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, where a handball by Inverness player Josh Meekings was overlooked, denying Celtic a penalty and a possible shot at the Treble."]}

Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace\u2019s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving.

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.\u2019 Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis\u2019 resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal.

The Anfield boss was fined at Blackburn Magistrates' Court for leaving a \u00a369,950 terrace house in Accrington, Lancashire, with broken windows and doors and rubbish strewn across the garden. The court confirmed the conviction when approached yesterday. However, Hyndburn Borough Council, which took the action, said in a subsequent statement that both Rodgers and co-owner Judith O'Hagan had their case overturned at a later hearing. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was convicted of leaving a property in Accrington to rot, but subsequently had his conviction overturned because he did not receive a summons . Rodgers was originally \u00a0told to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish from the garden . Mark Hoyle, Head of Regeneration and Housing, said: 'Brendan Rodgers and Judith O\u2019Hagan were convicted in their absence of failing to comply with a notice served on them by the council pursuant to s79 Building Act, contrary to S 99 of that Act. 'However the case against them both was overturned under section 14 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 at Blackburn Magistrates Court on the 28th April 2014 in the case of Brendan Rogers, and on the 9th July 2014 in the case of Miss O\u2019Hagan, as neither Mr Rodgers or Miss O\u2019Hagan had received the court summons.' The pair had been ordered to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish, but the house was left to rot. Both Rodgers and O'Hagan, who bought the property in August 2007, were absent when found guilty at Blackburn Magistrates' Court. They were ordered to both pay a \u00a3400 fine and \u00a3375 costs, with a \u00a340 surcharge.

{"input": "Wolves striker Benik Afobe kept their fading promotion hopes alive as his 31st goal of the season salvaged a 1-1 Sky Bet Championship draw against play-off rivals Ipswich at Molineux. Afobe, who scored 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before joining Wolves from Arsenal in January for \u00a32million, pounced after 50 minutes to cancel out a 21st-minute own goal from Richard Stearman. It was a vital strike from Afobe as the Black Country side were heading for a third successive defeat which would have all but ended their play-off hopes. Wolves striker Benik Afobe volleys home an equaliser for the home side at Molineux to keep them in the Championship play-off hunt .

Scorer: Stearman OG 21 . Booked: Parr, Tabb . Referee:\u00a0Stuart Attwell . While Wolves are just about still alive in the promotion race, Ipswich remain well placed for a top-six finish despite failing to hold on to the advantage they were presented by Stearman. Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy, who was in charge at Wolves for almost six years before being sacked in February 2012, has steered them to 75 points and knows that winning their final two games of the season would secure a place in the play-offs. Molineux manager Kenny Jackett had wanted a frenetic start and he got that through quick striker Nouha Dicko. Dicko had been left out of the starting line-up for the previous game at Middlesbrough and he looked like he had a point to prove following his recall, with pace which tormented Tommy Smith and his central defensive partner, Wolves old boy Christophe Berra. However, the hosts failed to make the most of his efforts and Ipswich were able to ride out the storm before taking the lead. New Zealand international Smith rose above the Wolves defence and met a corner from Teddy Bishop that was glanced goalwards and deflected into his own net by the luckless Stearman. Wolves took time to come to terms with falling behind and when they finally did force an attack of note Dicko saw his 33rd-minute shot blocked by Berra. That sparked Jackett's team back into life and they were unlucky not to draw level six minutes before half-time when Ipswich failed to clear their lines. The ball fell invitingly on the edge of the area to Dave Edwards, whose volley looked set to sneak just inside the post before Bartosz Bialkowski tipped it away for a corner. Wolves took that freshly found momentum into the start of the second half and, after Dicko flashed a header from a Bakary Sako cross just wide, Afobe continued his prolific spell in front of goal. Rajiv van La Parra's low drive was deflected into the path of Afobe, who reacted brilliantly to force the ball home at the far post. With parity restored, Wolves carried more of a threat and Berra found himself working overtime to try and keep the dangerous Dicko in check. Ipswich were penned in their own half for long spells and when they did break out, Freddie Sears failed to test goalkeeper Carl Ikeme as he dragged his 73rd-minute shot wide. Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal to hand Ipswich the lead on Saturday . However, the hosts were by far the dominant force and Dicko looked set to make that pressure pay in the 76th minute - only to again be denied from six yards by another well timed block from the hard working Berra. Failing to make the most of that pressure almost came back to haunt Wolves four minutes from time when substitute Chris Wood picked up the ball on the left flank and surged towards goal, only to see his shot curl agonisingly wide of Ikeme's far post. And the hosts' frustration was capped in stoppage time when Dicko just failed to connect with a bouncing cross-shot from Kevin McDonald.

Branislav Ivanovic had a tough afternoon marking\u00a0Marouane Fellaini (left) but he did well in the air throughout . CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) THIBAUT COURTOIS 6 - While United dominated, not much to do. Almost slipped up when he dropped a difficult cross. BRANISLAV IVANOVIC 6- Tough afternoon trying to get close to Fellaini but did well every time the ball came into the box in the air. Booked. GARY CAHILL 6.5 - Vital block from Falcao at close range. Almost ruined the whole effort with late tackle on Herrera that could have been a penalty. JOHN TERRY 7 - Strong up against Falcao and gave the striker no room to manoeuvre. Marshalled a backline that held its nerve. Cesc Fabregas (right) had a quiet afternoon for Jose Mourinho's side . CESAR AZPILICUETA 6 -\u00a0Little to do down the left as United focused on the other flank, almost set up Hazard for a second. KURT ZOUMA 5.5 - Outplayed in midfield as United took early initiative and couldn\u2019t get into the game. Mourinho will say he did his job. NEMANJA MATIC 7 - Back at his commanding best in second half after poor opening period. Coped well against Fellaini. OSCAR 8 - Brilliant back-heeled assist for the goal.

Her car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further .

At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments.

The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night.

'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

It was a tough decision coming after his admission that the coach he had worked with on the Costa del Sol was like a footballing father to him. Judging from comments made after Real\u2019s midweek win over Atletico Madrid, he still harbours some regrets over that decision to not follow the manager who really gave him his big chance. Pellegrini allowed him to star in the Champions League campaign that took Malaga all the way to the quarter-finals, where they felt only refereeing incompetence prevented them reaching the semis. \u2018I am not very content, I thought I was playing well,\u2019 was his message to Spanish television on Wednesday night after the win over Atletico. It was strange sentiment to convey with so much positivity around the club after their safe passage to the semi-finals. Spanish midfielder Isco is unhappy with his current role and playing time at Real Madrid . Isco rarely starts for Real Madrid when all of Carlo Ancelotti's main options are fit . He later tweeted: 'If we all stick together we will go further.' The show of solidarity was an attempt to gloss over the gut reaction after the match that revealed his sense of injustice at always being the player who sits out when everyone else is fit. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s first choice front three is Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema and his preferred midfield is Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez. Isco is the seventh man in that front six. And if Ancelotti persists with Sergio Ramos in midfield in Modric\u2019s absence, Isco could even sit back on the bench when Bale returns. If Pellegrini stays at City and Isco remains unhappy about how he only fits in at Real Madrid when there are injuries, the Premier League could appear on his horizon again. Isco joined Real Madrid from another La Liga side Malaga in the summer of 2013 . The 23-year-old had a choice of Real Madrid or Manchester City, and chose the Spanish giants . It would be too much to ask him to fill Yaya Toure\u2019s boots. Toure's great strength is the way that huge stride of his takes him up and down the pitch so quickly. Isco is more Smart Car than juggernaut and he tends to scurry more than maraud. He would have to play as City's No 10, he wouldn't be able to drop back into the middle two as Toure can. But at just 23 years of age, he also happens to be the player Vicente del Bosque intends to build his new Spain team around. He\u2019s also the player the Real Madrid supporters adore perhaps more than any other, and he would be on the same wavelength as David Silva, who needs a like-minded player in a City team that has put brawn over brains with recent midfield signings. Isco is one of Spain's new generation and Vicente del Bosque is looking to build the team around him . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini worked with Isco during their time at Malaga . Isco could still play a big part in what is left of Real Madrid\u2019s season but with the European Championship on the horizon at the end of next season he will not want to have spent the previous campaign on the bench watching Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo, Kroos, Modric, Rodriguez and whoever else Florentino Perez signs this summer.

Here is modern-day portrait of a historic British institution, by photographer Neil Hall. The inspiration: A statue at Rugby School depicting the moment pupil William Webb Ellis picked up a football and ran with it during a match in 1823, in an action said to be the beginning of the modern game of rugby after pupils wrote their own set of rules . In the shadow of history: A school plaque marks Webb Ellis' run, calling his decision to pick up the ball 'a fine disregard for the rules' Service: Pupils attend chapel at the historic independent school, where team sport has been played for hundreds of years . Still thriving: A pupil catches a line-out throw supported by fellow players on the fields of Rugby School where the sport is still played . Practice makes perfect: A young player shapes to pass during a training session at the Warwickshire institution .

Artefacts: An early rugby ball dating from 1850, left, and a cap worn by a pupil on his presentation to Queen Adelaide in 1839 . Historic: A printed book of rules for the game of rugby, left, which was carried on the pitch by players and a cap embroidered with names of opponents and dates of matches. Both items are displayed at the school, which is a tourist attraction for rugby fans . Making their mark: Desktops containing the names of hundreds of former pupils are also exhibited at Rugby School . Order among the chaos: The first handwritten rules of the game of rugby, dated August 28, 1845, are viewable at the school's museum . Father of Rugby School: The chapel grave of Dr Thomas Arnold, the headmaster who transformed the school's values and is credited with the 'muscular Christianity' ideal of the Victorian era . Former pupil: Britain's first prime minister of WWII, Neville Chamberlain, attended Rugby. He was succeeded in office by Winston Churchill . Rich tradition: Pupils at the school walk to lessons.

{"input": "Jose Mourinho resisted the temptation until someone mentioned defending. Arsene Wenger had been talking about how it was easier to set up a team designed primarily to defend, just as Brendan Rodgers had ventured after Chelsea\u2019s victory at Liverpool, last year. \u2018It\u2019s not easy, not easy,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018If it was easy, you wouldn\u2019t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It\u2019s not easy to defend.\u2019 Jose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on Friday . Arsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League . Arsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes. Monaco, ouch. Mourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco. They conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on. When Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision. \u2018Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,\u2019 said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday. \u2018Our job is to win football games and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in recent games. What\u2019s important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It\u2019s easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.\u2019 It is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title. Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the media . Prince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the Emirates . Wenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeat . The challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again? \u2018We have played amazingly well for most of the season,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team. \u2018But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.\u2019 Diego Costa\u2019s injuries and suspensions were Chelsea\u2019s shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal. Still they win, taking six points from their last two games \u2014 against QPR and Manchester United \u2014 while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. \u2018We are top since day one,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time out . Hazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league title . A TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge . \u2018We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam\u2019s from midfield, but spectacular team goals. \u2018So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.\u2019 It will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger\u2019s Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One. Since then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade \u2014 even during his six-year absence. Mourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers . The pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital . Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup final . They rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital.

Mourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest. There has been no apology. \u2018No, but I don\u2019t need that,\u2019 shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? \u2018I don\u2019t feel, I know,\u2019 he said.", "answer": "Chelsea can secure the league title if they beat Arsenal and Leicester .\nJose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have had a decade of touchline battles .\nMourinho has hit back at Wenger's 'defensive' jibes ahead of Sunday .\nHe said: 'If it was easy, you wouldn't lose 3-1 at home to Monaco'", "completion": ["Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger continue their long-standing rivalry, with Mourinho hitting back at Wenger's claim that it's easy to set up a team to defend, citing Arsenal's 3-1 home loss to Monaco as evidence to the contrary."]}

Coquelin played against Reading in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend and has cemented his place in the side . Wenger, though, has every confidence his side can again answer another stern examination. 'From a good run of form you get a good belief and we have a good solidarity,' he said. 'We know that we have passed many tests recently where we were questioned. This season is the first time we have won away from home against Manchester City [in a while].

{"input": "John Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season. The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side . Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe . Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 . Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone . Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it.

PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach and the Premier League is great' Van gall refused to squash the reports in his weekly media briefing. When asked about the Depay link, Van Gaal said: 'I don\u2019t discuss it with the media, you know my answer. 'I have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I've coached already.' Van Gaal, who worked with Depay at the World Cup, made inquiries over the player's availability last summer but decided to keep track of his progress rather than make a move. That could prove to be a costly decision, with the Dutch club looking for around \u00a325m for his services after he scored 20 goals in 28 games. Depay, who has 'dream chaser' tattooed to his chest and is pictured here modelling a three-wheeled bike in October 2013, could line up at Old Trafford next season. PSV coach Phillip Cocu was unaware of the meeting when asked on Friday. He said: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach with whom I have worked and he was always very pleasant and the Premier League is a great league. 'I have contact with Memphis on a daily basis about many things, but not on a specific club or league.' United hold the upper hand in the hunt for Depay thanks to Van Gaal, who worked with the player during his stint in charge of Holland. PSV appear to be resigned to losing their star man this summer.

Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better.

{"input": "The tears have dried but for how long? It\u2019s been almost a year to the day since Darrell Clarke cracked in front of the cameras as he explained how Bristol Rovers fell out of the Football League for the first time since 1920. If he had spent the entire press conference scratching his head in silence no-one would have blamed him. The circumstances were extraordinary; the chance they have on Saturday for quick redemption is made all the more fascinating because of what happened in that crazy finale. Rovers had spent less than an hour in the League Two relegation zone all season but, crucially, it was the last hour of the campaign. The music stopped, Mansfield had beaten them 1-0, the two other teams that needed to win had won, and Rovers were left without a seat. The tears came, \u00a31million from the playing budget went and Rovers were a Conference side, three years after being in League One. But, if nothing else, it taught Clarke that anything can happen on the final day. A year ago, Bristol Rovers lost their place in the Football League for the first time since 1920 . Darrell Clarke was distraught at the end of last season, but there could be tears of joy this time around . He needs that hope now, when the battle for the Conference title is wrapped up. It\u2019s between second-placed Rovers, who play Alfreton, and Barnet, who hold a one-point lead and a vastly better goal difference going into their game against Gateshead. \u2018It\u2019s a pretty big weekend for us,\u2019 Clarke told Sportsmail. It\u2019s not quite the Championship race for \u00a3120m \u2014 the financial boost available here is roughly \u00a3600,000 \u2014 but the real-world difference between Football League and the rest is every bit as significant. Barnet are heavy favourites to take the one automatic spot, by virtue of their lead and the fact Gateshead are safe in mid-table. There is also the fact that Wrexham approached Gateshead manager Gary Mills this week to discuss their vacancy. \u2018I know the lads at Gateshead and I know they will be professional and they have a very professional manager,\u2019 Clarke said. For his part, Clarke\u2019s players must beat an Alfreton side fighting to stay up. \u2018We both have a lot to gain,\u2019 Clarke said. \u2018We will be on our front foot from the first whistle to win.\u2019 If they do, and Barnet lose or draw, it will be a remarkable achievement and a rare one, considering no side have returned to the Football League at the first time of asking since Carlisle in 2005. If Bristol Rovers go up, they will be the first team to go straight back up since Carlisle in 2005 . Carlisle won the Conference play-off in 2005 and Bristol Rovers will hope to match their promotion success . The upheaval that followed Rovers\u2019 demise was dramatic. Clarke\u2019s own position came under review and he lost three members of his backroom team. \u2018It hurt me personally very much and for the club the finances changed and we had the consequences of that,\u2019 he said. \u2018People around the club lose jobs and that is hard.\u2019 Twenty players left after the budget was cut. \u2018We probably have only six players from last season,\u2019 explained Clarke. \u2018But we have worked so hard to be where we are. This is a hard league, but I\u2019m delighted with how we are going.\u2019 Clarke's Rovers had a difficult start to the season but have now only lost once in the last 27 league matches . It was a slow start. Five points from the first five games caused some anxiety and, in November, following their first game against Alfreton, an angry fan tried to board the team bus. On Saturday, they face them again having lost once in the past 27 league games and with the highest average gates in the division. Clarke, at 37, has salvaged his own reputation. \u2018We have had the best form in the table for months,\u2019 Clarke said. \u2018If we have to go to the play-offs, so be it.

Mark Lawn, the co-chairman of Bradford City, said: \u2018I am personally delighted that the FA, the Football League and Premier League have got involved. I would like to remind people that the PSBRU is solely reliant on charitable donations by the public, charitable organisations and businesses, and has no funding from the Government. \u2018I am extremely pleased that Bradford City has helped to fund the PSBRU through the supporters raising money. This has been enough over the years to help maintain and exceed the standards coming from the unit.\u2019 There are harrowing stories of almost entire families passing away that day in Yorkshire and serious questions still remain as we head into a fourth decade since the tragedy. They are laid bare in Martin Fletcher\u2019s new book, Fifty-Six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire, in which the author challenges accepted theories as to the cause. Nobody has been made accountable for events which saw Fletcher lose his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63. Fletcher has been researching the fire for 15 years and believes the investigation\u2019s findings are flawed. The inquiry asserted that the cause was, in all likelihood, down to a cigarette or a match dropped on to a pile of rubbish. He found that former chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995 aged 61, had been connected with at least eight other business fires and insurance claims. John Helm, the man commentating on the game when fire broke out, was candid in Sportsmail last week . Thousands watched on horrified as the flames took control of the stand to devastating effect . The variance in theories suggests, as with Hillsborough, a new investigation would be vindicated, offering potential closure for the city . Martin Fletcher\u2019s new book \u2013 Fifty-six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire \u2013 challenges accepted theories as to the cause of the fire. There were many cases of heroism, with more than fifty people receiving police awards or commendations . John Helm, the man commentating on the game when fire broke out, was candid in Sportsmail last week and refuted Fletcher\u2019s claims. \u2018Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind \u2014 any bitterness would be understandable \u2014 but from everything I have been told there isn\u2019t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. \u2018This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. \u2018Without making allegations against the club\u2019s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book \u2014 with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson.\u2019 A solitary bottle of champagne stands on the terrace - Bradford had been celebrating winning the Third Division title earlier in the day .

As many as 1 in 8 will suffer injuries serious enough that they will need to miss at least seven training sessions or matches. The Government wants rugby to be played more at school as part of plans to increase competitive sports, to curb rising levels of obesity. But Professor Allyson Pollock, an expert in Public Health at Queen Mary, University of London said these plans were \u2018extremely worrying.\u2019 The academic \u2013 whose son shattered his cheekbone playing rugby at school \u2013 said not enough was being done to monitor the number of injuries. Writing in the BMJ, she said the Government had a \u2018duty to protect children from the risks of injury\u2019 as part of a law enshrined by the United Nations. \u2018Given that children are more susceptible to injuries such as concussion and often take longer to recover fully, the Government\u2019s plan to increase funding of and participation in rugby in schools in the absence of a comprehensive system for injury surveillance and prevention is worrying.\u2019 She added. \u2018Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short and long term effects of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known. \u2018Many countries, including the UK, have inadequate child injury surveillance systems. Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child governments have a duty to protect children from risks of injury. Professor Allyson Pollock wants to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles \u2014 where nearly all the injuries occur . \u2018The UK government should ensure the safety and effectiveness of sports and that injury surveillance and prevention strategies are established before proceeding with its plans to target funding and increase participation in a high risk collision sport such as rugby.\u2019 In New Zealand, the current holders of the Rugby World Cup, sports authorities monitor the number of rugby injuries compares to the population making it possible to work out how risky it is compared to other sports. She also pointed out that other countries such as New Zealand monitor the number of rugby injuries compares to the population. This makes it possible to work out how risky it is compared to other sports. Currently, rugby is mainly played at independent schools rather than state schools where the dominant sport for boys is football. But in 2012 the Government pledged to increase both girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 participation in rugby at school as part of a drive to boost competitive sports. Professor Pollock\u2019s son Hugo suffered a shattered cheekbone playing rugby at school 11 years ago, when he was 14. In an article for the Mail, published in September, she described how his \u2018face looked distorted\u2019 and his \u2018eye socket was hanging down\u2019 She said: \u2018I\u2019m not calling for a ban on rugby at school. I\u2019m calling for parents to be given information so they know the risks, and I want to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles \u2014 where nearly all the injuries occur. \u2018I\u2019d like school rugby to become touch rugby, instead of contact rugby. All injuries should be recorded, and none should be acceptable or seen as \u2018an act of God\u2019. \u2018Most of all, children should be safe at school.\u2019 The Rugby Football Union \u2013 the professional body \u2013 has clear rules for school children and they are not allowed to tackle or form scrums until the age of ten. Even then, tackles are minimal and the referee will blow the whistle as soon as the player is brought to the ground.

Currently, rugby is mainly played at independent schools rather than state schools where the dominant sport for boys is football . Children under 10 play touch rugby where they have to pass the ball to the other side as soon as an opponent makes contact with any part of their body.

So to avoid another \u2018bend gate,\u2019 Apple is rumoured to be planning on using stronger materials to construct its next generation smartphone. The forthcoming phone could feature the same 7000 series aluminium as its forthcoming Apple Watch Sport edition, which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles. Scroll down for videos . And to avoid another \u2018bend gate\u2019 Apple is rumoured to be planning on using stronger materials to construct its next generation smartphone. This image shows a bent iPhone 6S . The material would make the next iPhone 60 per cent harder than the iPhone 6, Taiwan-based Economic Daily News reported. The metal is the same as that used to make professional sports bikes but has been altered by Apple to make it lighter, according to Cult of Mac. The forthcoming phone could feature the same 7000 series aluminium as its forthcoming Apple Watch Sport edition (pictured), which is reportedly also used in competition bicycles . The Apple Watch Sport has a lightweight anodised aluminium case. Apple used a new alloy of 7000 Series aluminium that's 60 per cent stronger than standard alloys. The same alloy is used to make racing bikes. The display is protected by strengthened Ion-X glass. Together, the materials make the Sport edition 30 per cent lighter than the other Apple Watch models. Apple polishes the aluminium used in its Sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch-proof outer layer. \u2018We believe this aluminium alloy sets a new standard both in the way it performs and the way it looks,\u2019 Apple\u2019s Senior Vice President of Design Jony Ive said previously. The next generation iPhones, which are expected to be called the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, are expected to be unveiled in September and may include a A9 chip and Force Touch Feature, which also features in the Apple Watch. It\u2019s also possible that the Californian tech giant will release a four-inch version of the phone called the iPhone 6C. Days after the launch of the iPhone 6, owners revealed they can be bent out of shape when stowed in a pocket. The handset is made from a combination of 6000 series anodised aluminium and stainless steel with titanium inserts, Forbes reported. Apple polishes the aluminium used in its Sports watch then anodises it to using tint zirconia beads to create a hard and scratch-proof outer layer . Addressing \u2018bend gate\u2019 after the phone\u2019s launch, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.' Tests showed that the phone bent out of shape under 100lbs of pressure - the same as the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. But accusations of unintentionally bendy handsets have dogged Apple since 2012, when some users claimed the iPhone 5 and later the iPhone 5S had a similar weakness. The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it\u2019s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.", "answer": "Rumours suggest Apple will used\u00a07000 series aluminium in the next iPhone .\nAlloy is already used to make sports bikes and the Apple Watch Sport .\nWould make next handset 60 per cent stronger than the iPhone 6's case .\nJust days after its launch the handset was shown to be easily bent .", "completion": ["To avoid another 'bend gate,' Apple is rumored to be using stronger materials, specifically the same 7000 series aluminium used in its Apple Watch Sport edition, in the construction of its next generation smartphone."]}

The dramatic footage shows Guillame N\u00e9ry standing at the edge before jumping in - all without scuba gear and simply holding his breath. And in the video he seemingly reaches the bottom of the 660ft (200 metes) hole before swimming back to the surface. French free diver jumped into Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. Guillame N\u00e9ry is seen at the edge before taking the plunge (shown). The hole is 660ft (200 metres) deep, although he doesn't go to the bottom. Free divers are able to hold their breath for more than 20 minutes . The video was filmed in 2010 by the Frenchman's girlfriend and fellow freediver Julie Gautier. It takes place at Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas, the deepest so-called \u2018blue hole\u2019 in the world with an underwater entrance. In order to stay alive, the brain is constantly telling the body to breathe. If you don\u2019t obey its primitive urges, carbon dioxide soon starts building up in the body, prompting an overwhelming desire to take a gulp of air. To fight that instinct, a competitive breath-holder has to work hard at expanding his lung capacity with a regular series of intensive breathing exercises. They practise \u2018static apnoea\u2019 once or twice a week, as well as \u2018dynamic apnoea\u2019 - holding breath while swimming - once in a while for fun, and also general fitness training. He also follows a diet high in fruit and vegetables, as well as broccoli, cauliflower and fish oil. However, N\u00e9ry revealed a few years ago that he didn\u2019t really reach the bottom of the hole - it\u2019s just filmed that way for artistic reasons. But the video is still incredibly impressive, as he holds his breath for minutes on end. Freediving is a form of underwater diving where no scuba gear or breathing apparatus is used. To breathe for minutes, free divers go through sophisticated mind-body control techniques to push self-induced apnoea - the science of not breathing - to the limits. Some free divers can hold their breath for more than 20 minutes. Stig Severinsen, for example - nicknamed The Man Who Doesn't Breathe - is the holder of multiple records in diving using his 'State of Zen' technique to control his breathing. In October 2012, Mr Severinsen broke the record for the longest time breath held voluntarily by a male by spending 22 minutes with his head submerged in a pool in London. The dive took place in 2010 at Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas (marked), the deepest so-called \u2018blue hole\u2019 in the world with an underwater entrance .

{"input": "This is one safety video you won't be able to take your eyes off. A dramatic virtual environment has been created using a headset that shows how passengers would survive a plane crash landing on water. The short film has been developed on an Oculus Rift - a virtual reality headset - by Italy's University of Udine's HCI Lab. It is hoped the simulation can make people aware of the correct processes to follow for a landing on water . The video is based on an actual event when, on January 15, 2009, U.S. Airways Flight 1549 was forced into a landing on water. Following a series of bird strikes, both engines failed, and the Airbus A320, piloted by Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger\u00a0was forced to land in the Hudson River. Incredibly of the 155 on board, only one person was hospitalised ovenight, and the incident became known as 'Miracle on the Hudson.' With the dramatic background music, this video could well prove to be much more effective than a safety notice and demonstration. The scene begins by the passenger being welcomed onto the plane by the flight attendant, before a gentle walk to locate the seat. The start of the virtual reality programme starts casual enough as the passenger moves to their seat . A large bang is heard on the simulation before the plane starts to rapidly descend . Once seated the film jolts into action when a loud bang is heard, and the plane rocks from side to side. As the plane descends quickly and abruptly, the user is told that the 'goal is to come out unharmed from the aircraft by following safe procedures.' The first thing to do is inflate the life jacket. What follows is a jog down the cabin and to the emergency exit, where the flight attendant is beckoning you out of the door and onto the evacuation slide. The video pans to the passenger reaching into the overhead lockers for their luggage . But doing this results in putting yourself in immense danger of drowning in the incoming water . There are cries, screams and shouting, just what you would expect from the real thing. A chilling scene then appears telling you to beware of making mistakes - in this instance it is wasting time grabbing luggage. This is shown when, after grabbing the luggage, the passenger is overcome with water - this actually forces the man who has taken the simulation on to remove the headset and puff his cheeks. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Luca Chittaro, head of the project, said: 'The 'Emergency Water Landing VR' demo we have just released for the Oculus Rift was developed in the last year, and is just one of a series of aviation safety education games we are developing for all possible technological platforms, not just the Oculus Rift. 'Airlines are already using video safety briefings on-board some aircrafts and they do not seem to engage passenger's attention any more than conventional briefings. Of the simulation video, he added: 'It's a personalized, experiential way of learning, more engaging than passively watching a video or a safety briefing or reading a safety card.' This user made it as far as the 'what happens if you reach for your baggage' before the water overpowering him made him remove the headset . And it produces measurable results. 'In the study of our virtual water landing experience, we had one group of people study a traditional airline safety card and another group playing the virtual reality game,' added Chittaro. 'After one week, people who had studied the safety card suffered a significant loss of knowledge, while passengers who had played the game fully retained the safety knowledge gained. 'Considering that 'Emergency Water Landing VR' is the world's first prototype of an airliner water landing and evacuation experience, we are satisfied with the result.'", "answer": "Simulation available on Oculus Rift shows  plane crashing on water .\nCries, screams and shouting heard as plane rapidly descends .\nShows what happens if you make attempts to grab your luggage .\nBased on actual incident in 2009 when U.S. Airways Airbus A320 made successful landing in Hudson River with no casualties .", "completion": ["Italy's University of Udine's HCI Lab has developed a virtual reality safety video using an Oculus Rift headset that simulates a plane crash landing on water, aiming to educate passengers on the correct procedures to follow in such an event."]}

Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just \u00a39, while Turkey has the most expensive at \u00a3166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries \u2013 the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US \u2013 but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just \u00a328 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn\u2019t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world \u2013 behind Sweden, Finland and Germany \u2013 with a fee of \u00a373.

Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact. \u00a0A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.'\u00a0This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon \u2014 the only supply ship capable of returning items intact \u2014 will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket.\u00a0SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit.

{"input": "The last two weeks have showcased all that is best about Lewis Hamilton. He has driven supremely well, gaining the congratulations of the man he hopes to emulate as a triple world champion, Sir Jackie Stewart. But seeing the two men on the podium \u2013 one as the winner of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the other conducting the post-race interviews \u2013 was a reminder of what differentiates them as individuals as well as what binds them together as exceptional grand prix drivers. Hamilton could do considerably worse than learn a few things from and about Sir Jackie. Lewis Hamilton is interviewed by three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart after the Bahrain Grand Prix . Hamilton crosses the line in Bahrain ahead of Kimi Raikkonen to claim his third win from four races this term . Lewis probably will not want to hear it, judging by how he has previously dismissed Stewart\u2019s opinions, honestly given when sought as a pundit who speaks with all the authority of the most successful British Formula One driver in history. Hamilton said grouchily, that he was disappointed ex-drivers were not being more supportive, as if blind adoration was his birthright. Here are just a few reasons why Hamilton should listen to Sir Jackie. He drove in an era when a driver racing for five years had a two in three chance of dying. He changed that through tireless campaigning for safety measures to save not only drivers but spectators from preventable injuries. And then there is his charitable work for a children\u2019s club in the east end of London, for mechanics fallen on hard times, and dyslexia societies. There is also his considerable contribution to British industry over more than 40 years. A perfectionist, he will quietly remove a hair of your lapel as he speaks to you. He is not without ego, but conducts himself with decorum. The 30-year-old Briton celebrates his second straight win in Bahrain to extend his lead in the championship . Hamilton finished ahead of Raikkonen (centre) and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in the Gulf Kingdom . I wish Hamilton could show a little bit humility towards the past. That he could see that Formula One history did not start with Ayrton Senna. If he could start to appreciate some of the wider picture he might find himself more widely liked. He might not spray champagne into the face of a girl on the podium as he did in China last week \u2013 hardly a hanging offence but, given that she could not respond, an inconsiderate act and an ungallant one. He might not gracelessly sulk, as he did most memorably at Monaco last year to Stewart\u2019s stated chagrin, when he is beaten. He might not be as surly as he can be at press conferences. He might not turn up rudely late to engineering meetings. He might not shun advice freely given by greats of his sport who speak candidly and without malice. Bernie snaps up PR veteran .

The usual, tedious political narrative accompanied the Bahrain Grand Prix. A starring role is always given to Nabeel Rajab.

The complaint is that he has been wrongly arrested by the Bahraini authorities, who are suppressing freedom of speech. But it is worth recording that he has been charged with falsely (according to the government) accusing coalition forces in Yemen \u2013 including Bahrain \u2013 of promoting ethnic cleansing by targeting women, children and religious structures. He passed off these claims with photographs that were not from Yemen at all, but of dead children in Gaza and a dead baby in Syria, both from last year.

The divorce petition was filed in late February in Tarrant County, Texas, where Hamilton played five seasons with the Texas Rangers before moving to LA, the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0reported. Hamilton, 33, married his wife Katie in 2004. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship and three more daughters with Hamilton. The petition doesn't detail the reasons for the split and only cites 'conflict'. In the petition, Hamilton outlined 34 requests. Among them, he called for his wife to be banned from using his Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer, the Dallas Morning News reported. He also requested she be prohibited from 'hiding' the children from him, from allowing men to stay the night while his children are home, and from making disparaging remarks about him or his family. But in March, Mrs Hamilton submitted a general denial to her husband's petition and this month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other throughout the case. Hamilton is not allowed to see his children without supervision, according to court records. He is also banned from going to the couple's properties in Westlake Texas; Newport Coast, California; and Valley Mills, Texas.

'10 years ago today, I said \"I do\",' he wrote on his Twitter page on November 10 as he shared a photo of him and his wife. 'There are no words to describe how much I love and adore this lady.' Earlier this year, Hamilton, a former Major League Baseball Most Valued Player, underwent shoulder surgery before spring training for the LA Angels. He then self-reported that he had suffered a cocaine and alcohol relapse - the latest incident in his well-documented history of substance abuse. Hamilton was suspended for three seasons between 2003 and 2005 and was ordered to undergo regular drug testing when he was reinstated into baseball in 2005. After his recent relapse, Major League Baseball officials said Hamilton had violated his treatment program, but the players' association disagreed so an arbitrator was called to make a decision. Uncertain future: Hamilton, pictured in October 2014, signed with the LA Angels in 2012 but self-reported a substance abuse relapse earlier this year. He will not be disciplined but may not return to the team . Without divulging reasons, the arbitrator ruled that Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, and the player will not be disciplined for the relapse. After overcoming his early addiction problems, Hamilton played for the Texas Rangers between 2008 and 2012 and was named the AL MVP in 2010. During that time, he had two public relapses, including one before the 2012 season. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $125 million contract with the Angels, but owner Arte Moreno last week said he could not guarantee Hamilton will return to play for the team. He claimed that Hamilton's contract said the deal could be terminated if he relapsed.

Make no mistake, sacking Paul Downton does not mean some magic wand has been waved and all will be well. There are deep systemic problems. Too many of the current selectors and coaches are from the old guard and have failed to keep pace with the dramatic changes that have occurred in one-day cricket in recent years.

Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Even the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain was a slow and protracted affair. They should have acted sooner. Like so much of English sport, our cricket system seems afraid of the maverick player and that has to change.

I hate it when things become about one individual and believe me, everything that has gone wrong with English cricket has not been down to the handling of Kevin Pietersen; however badly that has been done. But what is does highlight is the continued fear of the maverick player. From David Gower to Kevin Pietersen, English cricket has shown distrust for anyone who does not conform or fit into a safe stereotype even though all the players who are thriving on the world stage are non-conformists who do things differently. You wouldn\u2019t find Brendan McCullum or AB de Villiers audacious shot- making in an MCC coaching manual but you will not find two better strikers of a cricket ball on the planet.

{"input": "Ronny Deila insisted on Friday night that Scottish football would benefit if referees gave a public explanation of their decisions after matches. The Celtic manager stressed he still had a positive view of officiating in this country despite the Josh Meekings handball debacle that helped kill his Treble dream last weekend. But Deila has called for similar transparency as in his Norwegian homeland, arguing that referees facing the media would help quell long-running furores and improve relationships. Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks to the officials after his side's Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Inverness . Celtic wrote to the SFA in the aftermath of last weekend's defeat to Inverness, seeking 'to understand' how Steven McLean and his assistants failed to act on the Meekings incident. 'When my team has a bad performance, I have to stand in front of newspapers and everybody,' said Deila. 'If it's good, it's good. If it's bad, it's bad, but I have to stand up to it. 'I can't understand what the problem is with the referees doing it as well. 'They could say: 'I made a bad mistake, I'm so sorry, I'm irritated at myself, I should have done it better, I should learn from this.' What could you say after that? 'It's not important for me to speak with the referee. It's the Press. If the Press has a question for me and I say no comment, it never stops. If I say what I think, then you move on. 'It would be good for referees. We all know they will make mistakes in the future and do good and bad things. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . 'We will do the same, but just to be open and honest gets you much more respect. You have to be able to handle it through good times and bad times. 'If they shut themselves away, you don't get answers and that's why we are writing a letter to them just asking what happened. 'If not, we don't need to do that. They tell it to television. What's the problem? More and more in Norway, the referees go to speak to the media after the match.' Speaking in December, Deila said that Scottish referees had been 'fantastic' since he came to Celtic and that he had encountered more problems in European matches. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . 'I haven't changed my mind,' he insisted. 'You see mistakes all over Europe and I think the referees here have been good, I have no problems with that. 'It's just afterwards there are a lot of things. So many meetings, appeals, I can't understand that system. But that's not up to me, it's up to others.' Referees have performances evaluated by assessors but Deila feels it would be better if they came under a more public disciplinary system similar to managers and players. 'I think it is strange that we have to do it and not the referees,' he added. 'We are all one unit \u2013 football. 'I think it should be the same rules for everybody. If my players are not performing well then I talk with them. And the solution might be that they are out of the team. 'How do you punish a referee? You could give another referee a chance instead, give someone a break. 'In Norway referees get banned as well.

{"input": "Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new \u00a3400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a \u2018slide-out\u2019 grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new \u00a3400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are \u2018looking at options\u2019 in order to \u2018future-proof the design\u2019. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their \u00a3757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year\u2019s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: \u2018The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.\u2019", "answer": "Tottenham's new \u00a3400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .\nNFL said to be within five years of having a franchise in London .\nWembley Stadium currently hosts NFL International Series games .\nThree regular-season NFL games will be played in London this year .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Tottenham Hotspur news .", "completion": ["Tottenham is considering a new \u00a3400m stadium with a retractable pitch and extra-large changing rooms, potentially making it the home of a new NFL London franchise."]}
{"input": "Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was found guilty on Wednesday of first-degree murder in a deadly late-night shooting, sealing the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career ahead of him. Hernandez, 25, looked to his right and pursed his lips after the jury forewoman read the verdict. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper and amateur weekend football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez\u2019s fiancee. Hernandez\u2019s mother, Terri, and his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, cried and gasped when they heard the verdict. Shayanna Jenkins wept on his mother\u2019s shoulder. Hernandez later mouthed to them: 'Be strong. Be strong.' Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty on of first-degree murder . The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole . The conviction sealed the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40million contract and a standout career . The former football pro was also found guilty on firearm and ammunition charges. For reasons that were never made clear to the jury, Lloyd was shot six times in the middle of the night on June 17, 2013, in a deserted industrial park near Hernandez\u2019s home. Police almost immediately zeroed in on Hernandez because they found in Lloyd\u2019s pocket the key to a car the NFL player had rented. Within hours of Hernandez\u2019s arrest, the Patriots cut the former Pro Bowl athlete, who was considered one of the top tight ends in the game. Prosecutors presented a wealth of evidence that Hernandez was with Lloyd at the time he was killed, including home security video from Hernandez\u2019s mansion, witness testimony and cellphone records that tracked Lloyd\u2019s movements. Hernandez\u2019s lawyer, James Sultan, acknowledged for the first time during closing arguments that Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. Terri Hernandez clutches her son's fiance\u00e9 Shayanna as the jury returned a guilty on all counts . Ursula Ward, mother of the victim, reacts to the guilty verdict for former NFL player  Hernandez . Hernandez was pictured posing with a Glock handgun when he was a student in 2009 . Odin Lloyd has been identified as the man who was found dead less than a mile away from the $1.3million mansion of New England Patriots player Hernandez . But the attorney pinned the shooting on two of Hernandez\u2019s friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, saying his client was a '23-year-old kid' who witnessed a shocking crime and didn\u2019t know what to do. Wallace and Ortiz will stand trial later. Prosecutors have suggested Lloyd may have been killed because he knew too much about Hernandez\u2019s alleged involvement in a deadly 2012 drive-by shooting in Boston. But they were not allowed to tell the jury that because the judge said it was speculation. As a result, they never offered a motive beyond saying Hernandez appeared angry with Lloyd at a nightclub two nights before the killing. Hernandez faces further legal trouble: He is awaiting trial on murder charges in the drive-by shooting. He is accused of gunning down two men over a spilled drink at a nightclub. In the Lloyd killing, the defense argued that investigators fixated on Hernandez because of his celebrity and conducted a shoddy investigation in their zeal to confirm their suspicions. A court officer places handcuffs on the wrists Hernandez after the guilty verdict was read during . Shaneah Jenkins, left, girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd, comforts a cousin of Lloyd in the courtroom . THE EVIDENCE . Prosecutors produced neither a murder weapon nor a witness to Lloyd's shooting in a North Attleborough industrial park. Their case hinged on other elements: cellphone records showing Hernandez and two friends communicating with Lloyd around the time of the slaying; Lloyd's phone pinging cell towers between Boston and North Attleborough; surveillance video at Hernandez's home showing him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun minutes after workers at the industrial park heard gunshots; a joint found near Lloyd's body with Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. THE DEFENSE . During closing arguments, Hernandez lawyer James Sultan for the first time acknowledged what evidence pointed to: Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. But he described Hernandez as a witness, a 23-year-old kid who didn't know what to do after seeing a shocking crime. Sultan pinned it on Hernandez's two co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, both of whom have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later. JURY'S ROAD TRIP . Midway through the trial, jurors boarded a bus to tour key spots in the case, including Hernandez's home, the street where the victim lived and the spot where his body was found. State police stood guard as the jury inspected the street in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood where Lloyd lived with his mother and sisters. Jurors also trekked out in the cold to the snow-covered gravel lot where Lloyd's bullet-ridden body was found and toured Hernandez's mansion a mile from the crime scene. TEARS FOR A SON . Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, wept quietly at times during the trial. Overcome with emotion, she would sometimes leave the courtroom in tears when jurors were shown graphic photos of her 27-year-old son's body. Before Ward testified, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ordered her not to cry on the stand. Ward remained stoic. When photos of Lloyd's body in the morgue were shown, she mouthed the words, 'My baby, my baby.' HERNANDEZ'S FIANCEE . Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, was compelled to testify after she was granted immunity from prosecution. Wearing her large diamond engagement ring, Jenkins testified that Hernandez had told her in the days following the shooting that he was not involved. Jenkins testified she removed a box from their basement at his request the day after the slaying but never looked inside before she dumped it in a random trash bin. Prosecutors said the box may have held evidence including the murder weapon. Jenkins, who has a 2-year-old daughter with Hernandez, avoided looking at him during her testimony. THE SISTERS . Jenkins and her younger sister, Shaneah, both attended the trial at times but sat on opposite sides of the courtroom. Shayanna sat behind Hernandez and could be seen joking with him, several times exchanging whispered 'I love yous' when she attended. Shaneah would sit with Lloyd's family. Before he was killed, she and Lloyd had made plans to move in together while she attended law school in Boston. Both sisters testified while the other sat in the audience, watching and sometimes seeming annoyed. THE VERDICT . After Wednesday's verdict was read, Jenkins and Hernandez's mother clutched each other and cried. Hernandez mouthed to them the words, 'Be strong. Be strong.' The verdict came early on the seventh day of jury deliberations. He was automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors said Hernandez organized the killing, summoned his two friends to help carry it out, and drove Lloyd and the others to the secluded spot in the industrial park. During closing arguments, prosecutors also accused Hernandez of pulling the trigger, though under the law it was not necessary to prove who fired the shots to convict him. Security video from inside Hernandez\u2019s home showed him holding what appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd was killed. The surveillance system also captured Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz relaxing at his home hours after Lloyd was shot, hanging out in the basement \u201cman cave,\u201d lounging by the pool and cuddling Hernandez\u2019s baby daughter.

The decision to ban Hardy, who last played for the Carolina Panthers, followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games . Domestic violence charges against Hardy, who signed with Dallas last month, were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify. The jury trial for Hardy had been set to begin in Charlotte after he was accused of assaulting his former girlfriend, Nicole Holder, and threatening to kill her. The league's probe, which involved numerous interviews with witnesses and experts, concluded that Hardy violated the NFL's personal conduct policy by using physical force against Holder in at least four instances. 'The net effect of these acts was that Ms. Holder was severely traumatized and sustained a range of injuries, including bruises and scratches on her neck, shoulders, upper chest, back, arms and feet,' Goodell wrote. 'The use of physical force under the circumstances present here, against a woman substantially smaller than you and in the presence of powerful, military-style assault weapons, constitutes a significant act of violence in violation of the Personal Conduct Policy.' Hardy arrives at Mecklenburg County jail on the first day of his domestic violence appeal trail . Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, was accused of assaulting Holder last May, sending her to the hospital emergency room. The five-year NFL veteran was found guilty by a district court judge in July but appealed the verdict and was allowed to have a jury trial. Prosecutors said when Holder last spoke with them in November, she told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' Holder had already reached a civil settlement with Hardy, prosecutors said. Hardy may appeal the NFL's decision within three days. 'You must have no further adverse involvement with law enforcement and must not commit any additional violations of league policies,' Goodell wrote.

'We've been working on slipping that right hand and throwing; that's something that I've done for a long time. I was walking him down, he was catching me with a couple of kicks, I hit him big and he went down.' Mendes piled on the pressure from the first bell despite Lamas threatening him with a diverse array of striking techniques. Just shy of the two-minute mark, the piston-like right hand buckled Lamas and, despite his best efforts to recover, Mendes was just too much for him. Lamas did well to get back to his feet after the initial knockdown but Mendes swarmed him and subsequently landed some punishing blows, including a knee from the clinch.

Second-seed Nadal had easily seen off Nicolas Almagro in the previous round but found himself in trouble against Fognini, who had won in three sets in their previous meeting on the clay of Rio earlier this year. And on the same surface in front of Nadal's home crowd, it was Fognini who took the opening set 6-4 after a crucial break in the latter stages, though the second set was to prove an even tighter affair. Rafael Nadal was dumped out of the Barcelona Open after losing to Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round . In front of a home crowd, the world No 4 was looking for his ninth career title on the Catalan clay court . Fognini was able to save six break points in the opening game before conceding it to Nadal, though neither player really dominated even as the Spaniard went 4-2 up. After Fognini first fought back to 4-4, the set eventually went to a tie-break with Nadal this time having to work his way back from facing match point at 6-3 to level up. Nadal showed his resolve late on but it was Fognini who eventually won through 8-6, with his opponent missing a relatively routine forehand. It was Fognini's first win in his six Barcelona appearances but he will now face Pablo Andujar, who also caused an upset in coming through 6-3, 6-4 against fifth-seed Feliciano Lopez. Nadal, who was denied his 20th win of the season, cut an extremely disappointed figure after his defeat, going so far as terming it 'a disaster'. In quotes published on the Barcelona Open website, the world No 4 said: 'My game was mundane. I didn't have enough power, speed and control in my forehand. I didn't manage to push Fognini back. Fognini edged a hard-fought encounter 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) to move into the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open . 'Fabio played better and he deserved to win. I did not deserve to win. That's why I will accept the upcoming challenges. I will work hard until I get back to my best. But it will be a while. 'It's a very sad day for me.

British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19.

In Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, Raikkonen did exactly that, finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner-up to Hamilton. The performance naturally resulted in Arrivabene being asked as to Raikkonen's chances of staying, given he has an option on his deal for next year, but also whether Ferrari were interested in Hamilton. Arrivabene said: 'Does Lewis Hamilton call you? Because he never calls me.

{"input": "England and Wales are facing a new World Cup threat after Australia performed a U-turn aimed at drafting Matt Giteau back into the Wallabies squad. The master playmaker has been an outstanding force for Toulon in the French club's back-to-back Heineken Cup triumphs and Top 14 title success last season. Now, four years after his Test career appeared to be over when he was left out for the last World Cup, the 32-year-old has discovered that he is eligible to play for the Wallabies again. Toulon fly half Matt Giteau (left) takes on Leinster centre Ian Madigan during the Champions Cup semi-final . Former Wallabies Drew Mitchell (left) and Giteau have been integral to Toulon's European dominance . Giteau has not featured for Australia since he missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand . Like England, Australia had a policy of not picking anyone who plays abroad. But Giteau's supreme form for Toulon led to a clamour for him to be recalled and on Wednesday the ARU announced a change which is seemingly tailor-made for the man once known as Kid Dynamite. With immediate effect, Australia will pick 'elite' players based abroad \u2014 providing they have 60 caps and seven years of professional service at home. At a stroke, the Wallabies have gained more experience and firepower for the World Cup, while their Pool A rivals England and Wales have extra cause for concern. Former England lock Nick Kennedy was a Toulon team-mate during the victorious 2012-13 European campaign and the London Irish academy director told Sportsmail: 'When I turned up at Toulon there were many excellent players, but the one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest was Matt Giteau. AUSSIES WHO CAN PLAY . Matt Giteau (Toulon): Can operate at No 10 or centre. Has excelled in France and craves another shot. Drew Mitchell (Toulon): The 31-year-old former Reds and Waratahs wing has 30 tries in his 63 Test appearances. George Smith (Lyon): Openside with 111 caps was last picked by the Wallabies for 2013 decider against the Lions. ENGLAND STARS WHO CAN'T . Nick Abendanon (Clermont Auvergne): On shortlist for European Player of the Year award. Steffon Armitage (Toulon): Reigning European Player of the Year and having another superb campaign. Toby Flood (Toulouse): Usurped by Owen Farrell in the England team, the rise of George Ford has left him off the radar. 'I had watched him play for years but seeing him in training, seeing what he could do, was a shock. He is just so talented and is still one of the best players in the world. 'His ability is incredible, as is his decision-making. He's still got pace, his passing is so accurate and he's got a great kicking game. Defensively he gets stuck in, too. He's a great all-round player and, if anything, he has improved from spending time in France. He can do it all.' Giteau himself greeted the announcement from Down Under on Wednesday by tweeting: 'Massive news re policy change. The ultimate honour to represent your country, however form still must warrant selection.' That shouldn't be an issue. His Toulon team-mate, Drew Mitchell, is another Australian who could find himself back in World Cup contention but his initial reaction was to champion Giteau's claims. 'The fact he is not only playing in Europe but dominating it for a number of years \u2014 he not only would be able to handle Test rugby, he'd add a great deal of value in the World Cup squad,' said Mitchell . Ex-Toulon lock Nick Kennedy considers his former team-mate Giteau one the best players in the world . The ARU decision has been made in response to an exodus of leading lights to Europe. There are potential implications for the clubs who have recruited these players, who may now be called upon for Test duty rather than being able to commit themselves fully to their new employers throughout the season. That in turn may lead to renewed club v country tension, but not in the case of Harlequins, who have signed Australia lock and former captain James Horwill. 'It's not an issue for us,' said Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby. 'We never want our players to turn their backs on playing for their country and there are windows for that. If the Wallabies wanted to pick James, that's great.' James Horwill (above) has recently signed for Harlequins but will still be eligible to play for the Wallabies . Australia's revised stance will lead to further calls for the RFU to relax their policy against picking players based abroad but Northampton's England flanker Tom Wood on Wednesday echoed comments by Tom Youngs of Leicester about the threat to squad unity and morale if the 'exceptional circumstances' clause is invoked to call up the likes of Steffon Armitage from Toulon. 'I am not against it in principle but I wouldn't like us to back-pedal on that now,' he said. 'It could have an effect on the team and undermine some of the togetherness we have built. 'If people start to lose faith and think there is an imbalance, then people aren't pulling in the same direction.'

Flyhalf Matt Giteau and winger Drew Mitchell, who both play for Toulon, as well as flanker George Smith, who also plays in France, would immediately qualify to play at the World Cup later this year. Wallabies Will Genia, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Nic White, Peter Betham, Sekope Kepu and James Horwill are all off to European clubs for next year, while Wycliff Palu is decamping to Japan. Media reports on Wednesday said flyhalf Quade Cooper was on the verge of signing for Toulon and two other high profile Wallabies backs, Israel Folau and Kurtley Beale, have yet to commit to the ARU beyond the end of the season.

'It is deliberately a high number,' Pulver added. 'It ensures only the truly elite players overseas will be eligible and it provides real incentive for younger elite players to stay in Australia longer in order to meet that threshold.' The ARU's parlous financial position -- losses of \u00a33.26million for 2014 were announced this week -- has made it hard for them to counter offers from wealthy European clubs. Pulver said the ARU was going to be more aggressive about repatriating players in the future and hoped the new policy would make Australians less attractive to foreign clubs. 'I think to some extent historically, foreign clubs have looked at Australian talent as an easy target because of the policy we had,' he said. 'With World Rugby's Regulation Nine, we clearly have the capability to pull them out of club competition to play international rugby and maybe they'll think twice about recruiting some of these players.'

On the reports linking him with Newcastle, McClaren added: 'I haven't got a clue if I'm a candidate for the Newcastle job. McClaren insists his sole focus is steering Derby to  promotion at the end of the season . 'I think there was no secret that there was an interest in December and January. We talked about that and in the end they didn't have a manager then. 'What they did was appoint a manager [John Carver] and that is what they have got, and he is fighting for the job. 'While somebody is in a job it is a little bit disrespectful. It's disrespectful to John Carver, to Newcastle, my focus is purely on Derby.

We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.

{"input": "When even injuries are working in Leicester's favour, the other teams around the relegation zone should begin to worry. Leonardo Ulloa was not supposed to be starting this match, left out in favour of Andrej Kramaric. But when David Nugent suffered injury in the warm-up, Ulloa was sent on. Inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape. That familiar melody was hummed loudly by Leicester's fans at full-time, fuelled by Andy King's late second goal and the sight of their team moving off the bottom of the table for the first time since November.

Leonardo Ulloa gives Leicester the lead, scoring from Wes Morgan's knock down . One more goal would have taken them out of the relegation places instead of Hull, but much more like this and that will come. This is three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000. Manager Nigel Pearson has been here before. Leicester emerged for this game looking like, one imagines, the pack of dogs that Pearson once fought off with a stick while hiking in the Carpathian mountains. His side are finally bearing teeth at the end of an arduous season, two wins in succession providing genuine hope of a remarkable surge to safety. Shifting off the bottom for the first time since November was the carrot for this game should defeat be avoided. Pearson selected an attacking side, a 3-4-1-2 with genuine wingers in the wide roles. He sent on Ulloa for the injured Nugent and played Andrej Kramaric as No 10. Cambiasso (front) stretches to control the ball ahead of the oncoming Swansea forward\u00a0Ki Sung-yueng (behind) at the King Power Stadium . Leicester hitman Leonoardo Ulloa (right) strikes the ball to score his side's opening goal against Swansea during the match on Saturday . The home side began with feral ferocity. Straight from kick-off Jamie Vardy drove at the Swansea defence only being halted at the last by Federico Fernandez. The tone was set. The lead Leicester craved was theirs in the 15th minute. Ulloa made the Premier League sit up and take notice at the start of the season with a flurry of goals, but his failure to maintain the momentum contributed largely to Leicester's decline. This was his first Premier League goal in four months, but what an important one. Following a corner the ball was recycled to Marcin Wasilewski, who launched a long ball from halfway that Ulloa flicked-on to Wes Morgan, who had stayed up. The centre-back fed it back to the Argentine who lashed home under the diving leg of Ashley Williams. The King Power Stadium erupted, and Ulloa ran to the dugout to Jon Sanders, the club's player liaison officer, and share a hug. Leicester are very much together at the crucial stage of the season, as this performance illustrated. Swansea were nothing like their fluid best, restricted to long shots easily held by Kasper Schmeichel. At half-time Wasilewski was forced off, with Richie De Laet coming on, and Leicester switched to four at the back. Their energy remained. Three minutes after the break Marc Albrighton fired a shot narrowly wide, and shortly after Kramaric sent a chance over following a breakaway. Schmeichel saved well from Jonjo Shelvey, was again from range, but it was Leicester unpicking Swansea's defence with greater frequency. In the 55th minute Vardy crossed to Ulloa, who sent his header onto the roof of the net while back-peddling. A minute later, Ulloa got free down right and centred, Vardy miscued and Kramaric ballooned a very good opening over. This has been a theme of Leicester's season, always positive but too often missing chances. It has previously proved costly. It would have done again in the 67th minute, but for a stunning save by Schmeichel. Nelson Oliveira ran clear and stayed on his feet when Robert Huth made a desperate lunge \u2013 referee Lee Probert could have awarded a penalty and possibly red in any case. Schmeichel came out in star jump fashion \u2013 like his dad Peter \u2013 and thwarted Oliveira's finish.

Schmeichel grasped the ball and blew out his cheeks moments later after saving another snap shot from Shelvey. Jefferson Montero than saw his shot deflect wide off Morgan when it could have gone anywhere. From then the game was Leicester's. Through Vardy, Albrighton and substitute Riyad Mahrez they possessed pace to counter at speed Swansea struggled to handle. In the 73rd minute Vardy led a two-on-one breakaway but over-hit his pass to Mahrez allowing Lukasz Fabianski time to dive and block. Vardy was again clear six minutes later through Danny Drinkwater's pass and fell under contact from Ashley Williams as he pushed the ball past the Swansea captain. Pearson was incensed but it would have been soft. Vardy sent another chance over, and Fabianski palmed wide a stinging shot by Mahrez. But a minute from time Leicester did seal the win. Esteban Cambiasso, superb all afternoon, fired a free-kick through Swansea's wall, Fabianski spilled the ball, and King applied the required tap-in. The noise was phenomenal. Leicester believe.

{"input": "Fact. Whether he's your coach, manager or interim, Rafa Benitez wins trophies. The Spaniard's name is being uttered once again across the boardrooms of Europe this morning. His Napoli side's 4-1 demolition of Wolfsburg in the Europa League quarter final last night gave that ominous feeling that silverware is once again within his grasp. He may be demanding, occasionally abrasive and often expensive but ultimately Benitez gets results. Since 2002, Benitez has won 12 trophies with Valencia, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Napoli. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez saw his side beat Wolfsburg 4-1 in the Europa League . Gonzalo Higuain and Benitez celebrate after beating Wolfsburg in Germany . The 55-year-old is out of contract this summer and it makes him a man in demand. Manchester City, Paris St Germain and Real Madrid are all considering changes as are West Ham and Newcastle. While Steve McClaren is destined for the role at St James', Benitez will take stock of what offers arrive on his doorstep. His ideal is to return to England and his comfortable Wirral home overlooking the River Dee where his family, wife Montse and beloved daughters Claudia and Agata, are settled. The reality is, here, jobs of the calibre Benitez wants are scarce and the opportunities could come with a caveat. Manchester City, should they dispense with Manuel Pellegrini, ultimately want Pep Guardiola; his contract at Bayern makes that difficult though and Patrick Vieira's inexperience leaves them with a dilemma. Should they try Benitez? It goes against certain principles, Txiki Begiristain wants a fluid attacking style to bring glory and Benitez is seen as pragmatic yet tactically very astute. Yet, Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United may not have danced through City's midfield so easily in recent weeks had he been in charge. Benitez has won the UEFA Cup/Europa League twice with Valencia and Chelsea . Preparation is everything to him, almost laborious. His players are given briefings, tailored dvds, weak points to work on or to attack. His pointers are not negative, they're smart. When Chelsea beat Benfica in the Europa League final of 2013, Juan Mata revealed how Benitez had told them to target the back post where Benfica goalkeeper Artur was vulnerable. They won with a far post header from Branislav Ivanovic. Ironically, Benitez has been viewed as wreckless in Italy this season for not setting his team with greater emphasis on defence. They have lost to Roma and Lazio but dominated. It prompted under-pressure president Aurelio De Laurentiis to demand his players be locked away in a training camp. Film producer De Laurentiis does love a drama. Giving players a cuddle has never been Benitez's forte, nor saying that he loves them but he does give them a platform to improve. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 . Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . Javier Mascherano was told exactly where and how he would play as he and Xabi Alonso brought the best out of Steven Gerrard, Juan Mata excelled at Chelsea, David Luiz grew and Jose Callejon has transformed from an \u00a38m Real Madrid squad player to one now valued at \u00a320m by Napoli. He's a man who would certainly have a plan for messrs Silva, Aguero and Toure. West Ham could offer the project he craves should Sam Allardyce move on. A rich football tradition, new stadium; if the finance is right, Benitez would embrace it. Benitez loves a project and would relish being an underdog biting at the coat tails of the Premier League's elite. He was sold on one at Napoli. At first it worked, the squad was competitive and challenged for Serie A but last summer they didn't invest as heavily as their rivals and the squad has been stretched. It may sound familiar to Liverpool fans but he still looks like delivering Napoli's first European semi final for 25 years and Champions League qualification remains in sight. Benitez got the best out of Juan Mata during his time at Chelsea . Jose Callejon has been transformed from a squad player at Real Madrid to a star at Napoli under Benitez . Life has not been easy at Napoli but for now he will endeavour to finish on a high. The Wolfsburg performance is a timely reminder of what he can put in place though he can't help but demand more. 'We put in great games against Roma and Lazio, yet played worse against Fiorentina and won 3-0,' said Benitez. 'We played against the second best team in the Bundesliga and these players deserve credit. We still lack experience to control the match and not concede goals. We work on tactics, but can still improve. What I do not like is hearing people say the players are unprofessional or undisciplined.' Sam Allardyce's future at West Ham is uncertain as is\u00a0Manuel Pellegrini's at Man City and Benitez could be considered by both clubs should they be in the need for a new manager . Asked about his future he emphasised the need for change should he stay in Italy. 'I haven\u2019t decided anything. It\u2019s not hard for me to work with Napoli, but I have to understand the final objective, the planning, the investment in a training centre and stadium,' he said. 'If we go forward, then we\u2019ll see. The president has invested and worked hard in these years, but now we have to see what the plans are before deciding if we\u2019ll continue together.'

{"input": "Real Madrid's Champions League victory over city rivals Atletico on Wednesday night marked the eighth match Gareth Bale has not started this season... and Real have won every single one. The Welshman has received some criticism from sections of the Bernabeu support despite a bright start in Madrid, and these remarkable stats will do nothing to help his popularity at the club. The \u00a386million man has missed out on just eight starts in Real Madrid's 50 matches this term, but his team-mates have picked up a 100 per cent win record when he has been away, scoring 25 and conceding just one goal. Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season, through injury and omission . His latest injury, suffered against Malaga, meant he missed Wednesday night's Champions League game . Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute. Real were 1-0 up when he came on, and the score remained the same until the final whistle. In December, Madrid were already leading 4-1 against third-tier side Cornella in their Copa del Rey tie heading into the second leg, and Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest some of his biggest names. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Bale were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as Los Blancos recorded a comfortable 5-0 win. That's six games without Bale in the starting line-up, and six wins for Real. Moving into 2015, Bale played a major role in the team's start to the year, scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against Celta Vigo and his omission against Eibar on April 11. Bale was sidelined for Real's 3-1 win over Barcelona, in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty . Karim Benzema scored in a 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in October... Bale was injured for the game . Ancelotti stated in the build-up to the match that he had decided to rest the Welshman, while the team went on to win 3-0 against their struggling opposition. Bale again returned the side for two matches, a goalless draw against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and a win against Malaga in La Liga, but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash. Instead of taking to the field in the crucial European match on Wednesday night, Bale was resigned to watching the match from home, where he tweeted his support of the team. Javier Hernandez's goal against Atletico ensured Real have won all of their eight matches without Bale . The Welshman took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Javier Hernandez's late goal ensured another victory for Ancelotti's men, taking their Bale-less record to eight wins, no draws and no losses.

{"input": "Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt.

Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave.

{"input": "Alexis Sanchez is developing a fondness for Wembley Stadium. Two goals for Chile against England were followed by two goals in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. It is a stage that suits him and Arsenal will expect even more when they return for the FA Cup final next month. \u2018Let us hope he keeps that up and scores twice in the final,\u2019 said Santi Cazorla. \u2018We are happy for him. He is a key player for us, in a good moment.\u2019 Alexis Sanchez celebrates as his goals take Arsenal into the 2015 FA Cup Final . The Gunners forward wheels away after opening the scoring in the 2-1 defeat of Reading on Saturday . Sanchez slides to his knees as he keeps his impressive scoring record at Wembley going . After an explosive start to his first season in England, including a burst of 14 goals in 18 games, Sanchez has emerged from a more subdued mid-season with three strikes in his last three matches. The extra-time winner on Saturday, however, owed almost everything to a dreadful goalkeeping error by Adam Federici. Sanchez is shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year with Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard the hot favourite, but it may be the most impressive debut campaign from an overseas signing since Gianfranco Zola. Like Zola, who arrived at Chelsea in 1996-97, Sanchez can end his first season with an FA Cup win and Arsene Wenger will stress the marginal gains if Arsenal can claim second in the Barclays Premier League for the first time in a decade. The Chile international struck his second goal to save Arsenal in extra-time . Arsenal team-mates congratulate Sanchez as they head into a second successive FA Cup Final . Sanchez's second goal owed a lot to a mistake by Reading keeper\u00a0Adam Federici . If so, the Chilean signed for \u00a332million from Barcelona last summer has been largely responsible. He has been fabulous to watch, loyal to the traditions of Wenger\u2019s flamboyant attacking style with bottomless reserves of energy and a contagious desire. He has 22 goals and there are signs of a good chemistry developing with Mesut Ozil since the German\u2019s return from injury in January. They combined for the first at Wembley. Wenger has admitted for weeks that he would like to give Sanchez a breather but his influence has been so vital \u2014 and the race for Champions League places so tight \u2014 that the manager has found it difficult. And Sanchez just keeps going. His season started with 45 minutes in the FA Community Shield, his Arsenal debut, on August 10 and will stretch through to the Copa America in his home country. The 26-year-old also scored a brace at Wembley in Chile's 2-0 defeat of England in November 2013 . Sanchez celebrates his second goal against England before his move to the Premier League from Barcelona . He has played eight internationals since the World Cup, starting in seven, with six of them on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. \u2018Of course, we are all tired and so is he,\u2019 said Cazorla. \u2018He has the Copa America, too, but he just wants to play all of the time. Now, we have to rest and finish the season with the objectives we had at the start.\u2019 Sunday will be a test of Arsenal\u2019s progress. Can they stall Chelsea\u2019s title charge? Has Wenger made enough improvements to halt his terrible run of results against Jose Mourinho teams? \u2018We have to show we are now on a consistent level and it is a good opportunity to do that next Sunday,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018Let\u2019s finish this season well. We have six games, a big game next weekend and I believe we have the spirit, which is encouraged by the results. \u2018We have learned from our hiccups. We have matured a little bit. When we had a difficult moment against Reading the team kept going. We don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We just keep to our plan.\u2019 Per Mertesacker was forced off with an ankle problem but most of Wenger\u2019s injury worries are clearing. \u2018The Cup final is better than any doctor,\u2019 quipped the Arsenal boss.

In contrast to Sanchez, it has been a miserable first season at Arsenal for Debuchy, with operations on an ankle and a shoulder each ruling him out for three months. But the France defender is back and his next task will be a duel with Hazard. \u2018I am so happy, it is so important to be back on the pitch with the team,\u2019 said Debuchy. \u2018It was hard for me after the second surgery but I am strong in my head.

{"input": "Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola weathered his first major crisis at the German club after his team crushed Porto 7-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to move into the Champions League last four. The Spaniard in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week. Never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals . Thiago Alcantara jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the Bayern on their way . Damned to succeed, Guardiola repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five-time European champions for who a league and German Cup double was just not enough. He arrived at Bayern after their 2013 treble-winning season and expectations have not been lowered since. A semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on Guardiola to deliver another treble this time round. But plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long-time team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt quit after 38 years, saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to Porto, Bayern had a far-from-perfect preparation. The doctor is hugely respected by Bayern players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and Guardiola suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a Bayern icon. Pep Guardiola said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at Bayern . Robert Lewandowski made it three on 27 minutes as the Poland striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net . Failure to advance against Porto would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach's future in Munich despite having a contract to 2016. With Premier League clubs circling, a slip-up on Tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach. But the Spaniard, who won 14 titles in his four seasons at Barcelona, thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season, even without injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba.

Bayless, a veteran of countless big fights in Las Vegas, will celebrate his 65th birthday two days after supervising the Fight of the Century in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Nevada State Athletic Commission, acutely aware that the officiating has to be of the highest order, given that the fight is likely to attract an audience well beyond those who usually watch boxing, have wisely put their trust in the large physical presence and unflappable personality of Bayless. Recent controversial results have put the Commission under pressure to bring in officials from outside Nevada for the mega-fights here and have made one concession in that regard. Glenn Feldman, a much respected judge from Connecticut, will be among the three wise men scoring a fight which most expect to go the 12-round distance. The two other judges are Las Vegas resident Dave Moretti and Burt Clements, from Reno. Serious consideration was given to including a judge from overseas and John Keane, a British Boxing Board Class A-star official from Wellingingborough, Northampton was thought to be the favourite. Bayless has refereed previous super fights involving Mayweather and Pacqiao. Recently, he was in charge of Mayweather's difficult physical battle against Marcos Maidana and Pacquiao's spectacular knock-out by Juan Manuel Marquez. He will receive $25,000 (\u00a316,600) for the night's work in May, while the judges will each receive $20,000 (\u00a313,300).

Carl Jenkinson holds off the challenge from Jesus Navas during West Ham's 2-0 defeat by Manchester City . West Ham defender Jenkinson challenges Aleksandar Kolorov during the clash at the Etihad on Sunday . With Europe now not realistic and relegation not an issue, the Hammers would now seem to have little to play for but Jenkinson insists the remaining five games are not meaningless. The 23-year-old, who has enjoyed a successful season-long loan from Arsenal and could make the switch permanently, said: 'People in our dressing room are fired up. If you came in the changing room after the game you'd see that. 'People aren't resting on their laurels, people ain't happy finishing mid-table. We want to kick on. We have got something to prove now because we have been on a bad run of games and we want to put that right. We owe that to ourselves and the fans.' West Ham were never in the game at the Etihad Stadium, losing after a bizarre own goal from James Collins and a swift counter-attack strike from Sergio Aguero before half-time. James Collins scored a comical own goal to give Manchester City the lead on Sunday . Enner Valencia and Kevin Nolan did have late chances after City lost momentum following injury to David Silva but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest. Jenkinson felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season. He said: 'I wouldn't want to blame it on luck but a few things haven't gone our way lately and we have conceded some late goals. 'I think this was a different story - we made a couple of mistakes and got punished. Sergio Aguero doubled the lead for the champions as they ran out comfortable winners . 'Of course we have got to work on our performances but if you look at the last 10 games, our performances haven't been bad at all. 'We have had some really good performances but teams have scored late goals against us and we have ended up getting a point instead of three. It has been a bit frustrating. 'I just think early on in the season we were finishing everything. Everything we got was going in the back of net and at important times of the game. 'We have gone ahead in recent games but never killed the games off and have ended up conceding cheaply towards the end of the game. Of course that is a real kick in the teeth.

{"input": "Bayern Munich have joined Manchester United and Liverpool in the race to sign\u00a0Memphis Depay. The PSV Eindhoven star's talents have been compared to those of a young Cristiano Ronaldo by Ronald de Boer, who also claims United could have the edge over Liverpool in a battle for the Holland forward. The 21-year-old Dutch international has played a starring role in PSV's Eredivisie title success this season. He is the subject of offers from Liverpool and Paris St Germain while United have also made contact. Liverpool are making a rival push for Manchester United target Memphis Depay . Liverpool hope to convince 21-year-old Depay that he would get more regular football with them . De Boer has been impressed and suggested he could follow in the footsteps of one of Old Trafford's former greats and become one of the world's best players. '(Depay) is one of the biggest talents in Europe,' said De Boer on talkSPORT. 'He has skill compared to a young Cristiano Ronaldo. He is very lively, technically unbelievable, very skilful, very fast, he has a great goalscoring record, he can shoot from every distance - he has everything. 'For me, he is without doubt one of the best talents we have.' De Boer, the former Ajax, Barcelona and Holland midfielder who is now assistant manager of Ajax's youth team, believes the presence of Louis van Gaal as manager could give United an advantage. Depay played under Van Gaal during the latter's spell as national team boss. 'I don't want to say which club is more suitable for him, but if he goes to United he knows there is a Dutch coach there who knows him from the World Cup,' said De Boer. 'That is an advantage.' PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title in seven years after beating Heerenveen 4-1 on Saturday . Depay (right) celebrates the Dutch giants' success with manager\u00a0Phillip Cocu after the match . Pep Guardiola and his staff are planning for the long-term with wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery growing older and picking up more injuries. Bayern are keen on Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne too and Real Madrid's Gareth Bale. The latter wants to stay in Spain but De Bruyne, a firm target for Manchester City, could be sold at around \u00a340m while PSV want \u00a320m for Depay. Liverpool hope to convince Depay that he would get more regular football with them but their qualification for the Champions League could be crucial to the 23-goal winger choosing them over United. PSV value Depay at \u00a325million and rejected a \u00a314million bid from Tottenham for him last summer. PSV Eindhoven general manager Toon Gerbrands said: 'We have given an indication of the price for Depay, which is probably more than \u20ac25m. Therefore we can have no quibbles with Depay's management [over the price]. Gerbrands added: 'Depay must first reach an agreement with a club and if that club are willing to pay the transfer fee then he can leave quickly.' Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

{"input": "The relationship between the FA and Premier League \u2014 never great at the best of times \u2014 has deteriorated further with the ridiculous clash of fixtures on Saturday. Both organisations blame each other for their respective rights holders, Sky and the BBC, scheduling the marquee Chelsea vs Manchester United league match against the FA Cup semi-final between Reading and Arsenal. The Cup game attracted a peak audience of 6.9 million, over treble the 2m rating for the PL game on Sky. But both viewing figures would have been higher had they not coincided. Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final victory over Reading on Saturday clashed with a top Premier League fixture . With star quality including Wayne Rooney and Eden Hazard on show, Manchester United's visit to Chelsea took viewers away from the game at Wembley, bringing the Premier League and FA into another dispute . The FA say that the dates of the semi-final were known at the start of the season, while the Premier League point to the Sky fixtures for the weekend having been set last February \u2014 a month before the BBC announced their semi-final schedule. To add to the muddle \u2014 with the TV armchair fan the big loser \u2014 the Premier League purposely chose to broadcast fixtures involving top-four clubs on semi-final days. They do this because the FA Cup takes precedence and the league postponement means Sky often then have the bonus of a blockbuster live televised midweek game close to the end of the season that could have a bearing on the title race. But Chelsea and Manchester United both being knocked out of the Cup prevented that happening this season. Hazard celebrates the only goal of the game in the Premier League showdown, but viewers missed out . Luke Shaw, who has had weight problems since joining Manchester United, enjoyed one of his better games against Chelsea in a season when he rates his own performances as C minus. Coincidentally, hard-line United boss Louis van Gaal has banned his players from stopping at the permanent fast food van on the road leading to United\u2019s Carrington training base. The van has been a favourite pit stop for United stars, including David Beckham, down the years. But having no choice but to lay off their tempting bacon sarnies could be the making of Shaw, it seems. Luke Shaw was in impressive form at Stamford Bridge, and he might owe his form to a change in diet . Joe Root's football-style celebration of his two wickets in the first Test added some impetus to England\u2019s bowling team, with Root looking more like the next Test captain with every game. But not everyone was impressed, including former Crystal Palace manager Alan Smith, who is following England in the Caribbean and who tweeted his disapproval, adding that he was \u2018old school\u2019. But Smith is canny enough that when he sold his cricket agency Arundel, he kept hold of the wealth management business that still looks after a good proportion of the England side. Joe Root celebrates the wicket of Darren Bravo, but his exuberance has been criticised by Alan Smith . Kevin Pietersen is the elephant in the room, even at England\u2019s sleepy Sugar Ridge Hotel on the day after the first Test.\u00a0Alastair Cook could be seen in a long conversation with Test Match Special\u2019s Jonathan Agnew.

{"input": "Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Frank Lampard\u2019s role at Manchester City was always planned as being just a bit part player \u2013 but maybe the 36-year-old should have started more games. The 2-0 win over West Ham was his 38th appearance of the season but only the eighth time Manuel Pellegrini included him in the first eleven. Of those matches City have won seven \u2013 including the 3-2 over Bayern Munich \u2013 drawn one and not lost any, scoring 22 goals with just six conceded. Mind you, Lampard was always going to do well against The Hammers. In the last ten years he\u2019s played 15 against his old club whose fans love to hate him, won 13 and drawn twice. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini should have given Frank Lampard (left) more game time . 2. In an era when yellow cards get dished out to defenders like confetti, Phil Jagielka is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking on club duty. The 32-year-old did get his name taken during England\u2019s 3-1 win over Slovenia in November, but the 1-0 win over Burnley was his 46th appearance in all competitions for Everton without getting into trouble despite being in the thick of the action, making 16 clearances. Jagielka is the only central defender in the Premier League not to have been shown at least one card. Phil Jagielka (left) is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking . 3. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa. While Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish were the creative stars in midfield in the 2-1 FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool, it was the former England ace who created the platform for them. Cleverley, still on loan from Manchester United and out of contract in the summer, made seven tackles \u2013 two more than Liverpool\u2019s midfield put together. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa . 4. Marc Albrighton is emerging as a key weapon for Leicester in their fight for survival after spending most of the season as a barely used sub. The winger, who moved from Aston Villa on a free transfer last summer in search of regular football, has instead had to go until the last two games before boss Nigel Pearson has given him 90 minutes on the pitch. It\u2019s been worth the wait. At West Brom last week he set up one of the goals in the 3-2 win, and he made four chances in the 2-0 victory over Swansea. Marc Albrighton looks to get past Nelson Oliviera during Leicester's 2-0 Premier League win on Swansea . 5. Tony Pulis always insists there is no additional incentive when he\u2019s facing former clubs, but he still finds something extra in his teams against them. The 2-0 win for West Brom at Crystal Palace made it three wins out of three in reunion games without a goal conceded. Pulis got a 1-0 win when he was Palace boss against Stoke last season, the same score by which he beat Stoke again as West Brom boss this year before then going to Selhurst Park to end Alan Pardew\u2019s run of four wins in a row. Tony Pulis shouts instructions to his players during West Brom's 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace . 6. At 37 years old Didier Drogba may not be the force he once was, but the Chelsea centre forward can still put in a shift for Jose Mourinho when he needs to. According to the EA Sports performance data the giant Ivory Coast star ran 6.7 miles in Chelsea\u2019s 1-0 win over Manchester United, only a tenth of a mile less than the distance covered by rival striker Radamel Falcao. He also covered more ground at sprint speed than the Colombian, who is eight years younger than him. Didier Drogba\u00a0covered more ground at sprint speed than Manchester United's Radamel Falcao on Saturday . 7. It\u2019s been a long wait for Mesut Ozil to live up to his \u00a342.5million transfer fee but the German World Cup star is now finding his true form at just the right time. The 26-year-old provided the assist for both of the Alexis Sanchez goals against Reading that took Arsenal into the FA Cup Final. It\u2019s the second time this season he\u2019s provided two assists in a game, both occasions coming since the start of March. Since the end of January when Ozil recovered from a knee ligament the Gunners have won 13 of the 15 matches he\u2019s played. Mesut Ozil (right) was in fine form as Arsenal earned a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday . 8. With three points separating the top four clubs in the Championship, the race for a place in the Premier League is the tightest ever with two games left. And it\u2019s not much easier for those trying to get into the top flight via the play-offs, either. Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six despite the 1-1 draw at Wolves taking them to 75 points \u2013 a total which would have been enough to guarantee a play-off spot in all of the last 14 seasons. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six . 9. MK Dons banked \u00a35million for selling teenage midfield star Dele Alli to Tottenham in the January window but must be thankful they borrowed him back for the rest of the season. The 19-year-old took his haul for the campaign to 16 goals as got the last in a 6-1 demolition of Leyton Orient which means Karl Robinson\u2019s side have now scored a club record 90 League One goals. If Dons get promotion they\u2019ll be hoping to borrow Alli for another year to continue his development at Championship level.

Gary Johnson is in danger of having two relegations in one season on his CV unless he can get some points from Cheltenham\u2019s last two games against promotion chasing Shrewsbury and at Wimbledon. The 59-year-old, in charge until February at Yeovil who are already doomed to drop out of League One, took a big gamble agreeing to try to rescue the Robins from losing Football League status after a chaotic season.

Falcao started in Manchester United's 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, but despite playing the full 90 minutes for a side that bossed over 70 per cent of the ball, he struggled to get involved in the game. The striker saw a shot blocked by Gary Cahill and had another two shots fly wide in the second half. But otherwise the Colombian's biggest impact was a negative one as he lost the ball following a John Terry challenge in the build up to Eden Hazard's winning goal at Stamford Bridge. Following another failed audition in front of manager Louis van Gaal, Falcao's Premier League adventure is set to go down as a costly mistake for the Red Devils.

Benteke has two years left on his contract once this season is completed and harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood said the Belgium international had given no suggestion he would like a transfer away and appeared to be enjoying his football at Villa Park. But the Villa manager admitted that, were the 24-year-old to demand a move, as he did two years ago, he would be inclined to sanction it.

I\u2019m not too sure how they go about it here,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018But it\u2019s certainly something that will have to be addressed.

Paris Saint-Germain striker Ibrahimovic will now miss three games and Marseille playmaker Payet just one after both clubs succeeded with appeals to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF). Ibrahimovic was initially banned for four games by the French Football League (LFP) when he was caught on camera after last month's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux launching into a tirade against official Lionel Jaffredo while walking back to the dressing room. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game! He will be back in Ligue 1 away against Nantes!' That game takes place on May 2. The suspensions have led to tensions with Canal+, the network which broadcast both video clips. Dimitri Payet has also had his ban reduced by one after an appeal to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) The two clubs, bitter rivals of each other, put out identical press releases last Friday stating that they would no longer speak to Canal+ until May 30. LFP president Frederic Thiriez sympathised with that stance and told reporters in France: 'I understand the two clubs. This manner of using what happens in the players' tunnel simply to create a scandal creates a problem of fairness in football. 'The presence of a camera, which is not always visible, could eventually lead to a suspension. That could have an effect on the end of the championship.' OM were happy to make use of Canal+ in the fall-out over Ocampos' disallowed goal, however, tweeting a picture of the channel's 3D goalmouth simulation.

Manny Pacquiao works up a sweat shadow boxing during preparations for his clash with Floyd Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine . Yet he warns Floyd Jnr that if does beat Pacquiao and wants to go on to eclipse Rocky Marciano's historic record of retiring as undefeated world champion after 49 straight wins, then he should 'stay away from our own Amir Khan.' Hatton, who talks from the painful inside knowledge of having been knocked out by the men currently considered to be the two best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, says: 'We all know Mayweather has this brilliant defence but one of his greatest strengths is his ability to adapt in the ring. It is that boxing brain which is Pacquiao's big problem. 'Manny has the style to beat Floyd. The speed. The quick hands and feet. He's a fast southpaw, which is what gives Mayweather trouble. 'Roach won't tell him to go charging at him down the pipe. He'll want him to throw a lot more punches than Floyd, who picks his shots. But he'll tell him to do it by nipping in and out so he doesn't get caught by Floyd's counters.' Ricky Hatton, pictured at his gym earlier this year, says Pacquiao has the style to beat Mayweather . It was a vicious left hand from Pacquiao that left Hatton on the canvas in Vegas in 2009 . Pacquiao takes on Mayweather six years to the day after knocking Hatton out at the same venue . Hatton also says having trainer Freddie Roach (right) in his corner gives Pacquiao a huge advantage . Mayweather Snr trained Hatton for his fight with Pacquiao and the Hitman says: 'I don't want to knock him but I was shocked that he couldn't do southpaw pads. That's a big disadvantage for Floyd. 'And in Freddie, Manny has one of the greatest trainers in the world. He'll make a huge difference. 'But I still go back to my initial feeling that Floyd will work out how to beat him, somehow. He's so clever. Win or lose he will still go down as one of the best of all time. If he wins I'm sure he will want to go on to beat Marciano's record. He'll be on 48-0 and he'll probably be due any easy fight to get him level with Marciano.' And that means staying well clear of Khan.

But Amir's been boxing much better lately, with a lot more discipline. 'And with Mayweather dipping slightly at 38 \u2013 probably not at the peak he was when he fought Oscar De La Hoya and me \u2013 Amir could be the one who's even faster than Floyd.

'Amir's right to keep Kell Brook on hold while he waits to see if he can get the winner on May 2. Kell would do the same. But he could have to wait even longer unless Mayweather-Pacquiao is a big anti-climax, which it could be if they're both cagey because they have so much respect for each other.

{"input": "Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. A new book claims that the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident. A memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at Valley Parade . The judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand. Sutcliffe said: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he was did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' The new claims are contained in the book 'Fifty-Six - The Story of the Bradford Fire' by Martin Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped with his life from the blaze but lost three generations of his family including his father and brother. The book, published on Thursday and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe a new inquiry into the Bradford fire is justified . 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' he asks. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty's Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' Fletcher's 11-year-old brother was the fire's youngest victim while his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, also died. The disaster occurred at a time, according to Fletcher's evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it wo uld cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford's promotion from the old Third Division. Yet this did not feature in the Popplewell Inquiry, which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire. Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. The book is released on April 16.

The Welsh fort, which defended Britain from French invasion, will be joined to the mainland thanks to a 328ft footbridge across the sea.

A rarely-seen Napoleonic fort, off the coast of Tenby, will now be accessible via footbridge for the first time . But tomorrow, planners are due to approve a new footbridge, which will stretch more than 328 ft (100 metres). This connector will open up the island from the coast of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, for the first time. Developer Peter Prosser wants to make the island accessible to sightseers in order for them to explore the fort, built in 1867, and also for visitors to experience the stunning views. He said: 'Putting a bridge across is integral and that 100m is critical. 'The tides limit pedestrian access to the island to one week in two and for a maximum of six hours per day.' Currently, the fort on St Catherine's Island can only be reached by crossing a beach during low tide . The new visitor site will provide economic benefit, and also restore the historical building to its former glory . It's expected that the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority will approve the plans, which also include an on-site gift shop, security office and paths. Not only will the new visitor attraction provide economic benefit, but it will also protect the integrity of the historic building, which was home to a Napoleonic lookout post. Such a reopening is also noteworthy as it's has been closed to the public since the 1970s, when it was turned into a zoo. The soon-to-be-opened island also plans to host historical, nature and stargazing exhibitions in the future . Mr Prosser said that though the concept of a bridge has been approved, the specific design needs to be approved. Although there was only a small church on the 200m long island for generations, it was taken over by the War Office in the 1860s to house a fort.

{"input": "You won\u2019t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by-laws of the game: until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on FIFA\u2019s front step, the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut. Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard\u2019s infamous \u2018ghost\u2019 goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard\u2019s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein \u2013 with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer\u2019s line in the last-16 match \u2013 for the dam to finally burst. Despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal-line technology to be approved, FIFA relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in Brazil. The lesson for Scottish football fans still bemused by events at Hampden Park on Sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game-changing handball? Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years\u2019 time will common sense prevail. For those who believe the SFA are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen Josh Meekings red carded and Celtic awarded a penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final, here\u2019s some news\u2026 . In February, the International Football Board \u2013 the SFA, FA, Irish FA, Welsh FA and FIFA \u2013 gathered in Belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials. Before the meeting, FA representative David Gill made no bones about his association\u2019s stance. Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . \u2018We can\u2019t live in the past,\u2019 he stated. \u2018Greg Dyke the (FA chairman) has come out and said he embraces it, and I think in certain circumstances I would look at it. We\u2019ve got to move forward. The game is getting much quicker. \u2018The TV coverage, you know, 28, 30 cameras a game. Everything is replayed, replayed. So how do we use that? My personal view is yes, sensibly, but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn\u2019t detract from the fast-paced, quick action of football.\u2019 Despite cases also being forwarded by the SFA and Irish FA to at least take the matter further, FIFA, aided by a sceptical Welsh representative, simply kicked the matter into the long grass. It won\u2019t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim. \u2018It\u2019s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played,\u2019 said FIFA\u2019s secretary general Jerome Valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards. While that may well be the case, procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it. Injustices like those that almost certainly cost Celtic a place in the Scottish Cup Final on Sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . Yet, until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a World Cup match involving one of the game\u2019s heavyweights, they seem set to remain an ugly, unsatisfying feature of the landscape. To the great embarrassment of Michel Platini, the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time. Seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman, \u2018additional assistant referees\u2019 - to give them their Sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009-10 Europa League. On Sunday, Alan Muir, the official behind the goal, should have had a clear view of Meekings\u2019 handball. But for reasons best known to himself, he failed to advise referee Steven McLean on what seemed an inevitable course of action. It took the high-profile blunder that denied Frank Lampard in 2010 to shift FIFA on goal-line tecnhology . \u2018I knew it was a penalty,\u2019 said Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths. \u2018I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. I asked the ref why he didn\u2019t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him (Meekings) on the face.\u2019 There is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence. McLean and Muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and, even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment, assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made. That they didn\u2019t is another blight on what\u2019s been a desperate season for officiating in this country. Perhaps more than ever, the SFA now has good reason to press FIFA to at least road-test video technology. It\u2019s hardly unchartered territory in sport. For those who prefer the oval ball game, a Television Match Official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now. No-one claims the system is perfect \u2013 decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it hasn\u2019t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at. Lampard's disallowed goal forced FIFA to rethink, and Scottish fans must hope for a similar incident . Used only in first-class and international televised games, the TMO can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him. This usually involves, in try-scoring situations, whether a player\u2019s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded, but the TMO is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play. While the video review is normally conclusive, the snag \u2013 which is clearly a red flag for FIFA \u2013 is the time delay. At a recent Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Saracens, it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed. Edward Griffiths, the Saracens chief executive, later labelled the TMO process \u2018a shambles\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s almost make it up as you go along,\u2019 Griffiths said. Indeed, rugby\u2019s growing concern over the effect the TMO is having on the sport has led to Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking technology company, to hold talks with the International Rugby Board about providing a replacement to the current system. Rugby's TMO may not be perfect, but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology . Hawk-Eye, which is already used in cricket, tennis and for goal-line decisions in football, says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Paul Hawkins, the founder of Hawk-Eye, said: \u2018Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie Rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made.\u2019 It can be assumed that, were FIFA to give tacit approval to video technology, Hawk-Eye would have just the programme to fit the bill. Using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 Laws of the Game are correctly applied. For football, the answers are already out there.

{"input": "Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered. Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY . Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL . Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND . Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER . Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES . Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL . Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR . Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM . Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "answer": "Richie Benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer .\nHis commentary style is considered\u00a0synonymous\u00a0with cricket .\nSportsmail\u00a0recalls 10 of his best moments in the commentary box .\nREAD: When Richie Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax .\nCLICK HERE for Richie Benaud tributes as cricket world mourns legend .", "completion": ["Cricket commentator Richie Benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer, leaving behind a legacy of memorable moments from his broadcasting career."]}
{"input": "Toby Alderweireld is ignoring the background noise about his future, such is the on-loan defender's determination to complete Southampton's 'special season' by securing European qualification. Eyebrows were raised last summer when the 26-year-old moved to St Mary's on a season-long loan, just months after playing for Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. Alderweireld's form on the south coast has attracted interest from the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham, but Ronald Koeman's side have the option to make the deal permanent for just \u00a36.8million. Toby Alderweireld has been in superb form this season at Southampton since joining on loan from Atletico . The Belgium international has expressed a desire to stay at Saints, but the waters are muddied by Atletico's ability to nullify the buy-out clause by paying them \u00a31.5million. Jose Luis Perez Caminero recently indicated the Primera Division club would invoke that clause, saying Diego Simeone's men were counting on him for next term, but Alderweireld is unclear whether he will be at St Mary's, the Vicente Calderon or elsewhere. 'I saw something in the Spanish papers,' said Alderweireld. 'I don't know, I didn't hear from them. We will see. 'It is not (frustrating) because it does not matter what they say, what is in the papers. 'I am just focused on Southampton and we are playing for a European spot, so it is going to be a special season. 'I am focused, I am happy here, so, yeah, no problem for me.' Alderweireld has been one of Southampton's best players in a remarkable season. Many predicted a relegation battle for Koeman's men, yet Saturday's 2-0 win against Hull saw them equal the record Premier League points tally of 56 set last year. Last season Alderweireld was playing in the Champions League final for his parent club, and he could return . 'It is has been a very nice season,' Alderweireld said. 'We like to play football, we have a good team and we have good results. 'We are playing for the European spots so I am happy.' The win over Hull was unconvincing but gave Southampton's faint top-four hopes a boost. Bettering the fifth place of 1985 looks a big ask but not impossible after James Ward-Prowse's penalty and a late Graziano Pelle strike. 'We just have to look to ourselves and not to look to other teams,' Alderweireld said. 'We know we have six games left, so it is going to be a hard sprint. 'The games are all tough, like next week Stoke away. It is a very difficult game, but we are going to try and win our games. The Belgian defender tackles Stephen Quinn, and says he is ignoring rumours about going back to Spain . 'We know we have Tottenham at home so we can do good business, but first we have to go to Stoke and that is going to be difficult.' The result leaves Hull further in the mire given they face an unenviable run of fixtures from now until the end of the season. City have a two-week break before their next match at Crystal Palace, where Michael Dawson knows they need to put Saturday's disappointment behind them. 'It is a massive disappointment,' the Hull skipper said. 'The first half, I thought we got right at them and I think Harps (goalkeeper Steve Harper) probably made one save. 'We were hoping to do the same in the second, but goals change games, big decisions in games. Alderweireld is focused on European qualification, and Saints took another step towards that goal against Hull . 'The yellow card incident where Alex (Bruce) is covered in claret, where (Graziano Pelle) has caught him flush straight in the face, that for me is a red card, but obviously with the penalty the ref got that right. Two big decisions. 'There was a lot more chances created by us than them, but at the end of the day we go away with no points which is a massive disappointment for us. 'The teams in and around us are winning, so it's about ourselves. We need to starting picking up some points.' Hull captain Michael Dawson admitted that his team need to start picking up points if they are to survive .", "answer": "Toby Alderweireld is on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid .\nBelgian defender can join permanently in the summer for just \u00a36.8million .\nBut Atletico may want to bring him back to the Vicente Calderon .\nManchester City and Tottenham also interested in the defender .\nAlderweireld focused on helping Saints qualify for Europe .", "completion": ["Toby Alderweireld, on-loan defender at Southampton, is focused on securing European qualification for the team, despite rumors about his future and interest from Manchester City and Tottenham."]}

'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play.

{"input": "They played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance, these really are dark days for Newcastle United. Still, at least they returned a club record profit of \u00a318.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby . Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory . 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light . This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in . There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this \u2013 grey, with little sign of light.

Former two-weight world champion Haye, 34, was stopped by officials on his arrival at Dubai International Airport and accused of fraud by writing a cheque as payment for a new property which bounced. The boxer\u00a0also handed over his passport to authorities, and has been unable to leave the United Arab Emirates - forcing him to miss a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham at the weekend. Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a \u00a3341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified. I explained to the police and presented documents as proof. But I can totally understand these mistakes can happen.' Writing a cheque that later bounces is a crime in Dubai, and can be punishable with jail, a fine, and being ordered to pay the amount. Haye, 34, was stopped by officials after his arrival at Dubai International Airport for a holiday . Haye was reportedly taken to\u00a0Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day . Police give suspects one month to pay the value of the cheque, before taking the case to court. Figures released last June showed that Dubai police dealt with almost 80,000 bounced cheques in 2013/14, worth 9.4 billion Dirham, or \u00a31.7 billion. According to The Sun, Haye was held at the airport as he arrived for a\u00a0holiday earlier this month after he was flagged up on a wanted list. He was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day. Haye had been due to attend a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, but was unable to leave Dubai. Instead he went to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi . He surrendered his passport, as did two of his associates. The Foreign Office is understood to have had no involvement in the case. During his stay in Dubai, Haye has reportedly been staying at the luxurious Palm Jumeirah development,\u00a0and has been tweeting photographs of himself enjoying the sunshine, as well as meeting fans. He posted a video to his Instagram account today thanking fans for their concern over an 'administrative issue' as he walked along a beach in the sunshine. In the video, which he captioned 'Don't worry about me too much!!!', he said: 'Thanks for all your worry and concern but don't get too stressed about me, things aren't that bad. 'A little administrative issue has left me in Dubai for a few days longer than anticipated but it's getting smoothed out as we speak and I'll be back - probably in London or Las Vegas soon.'

In an Instagram message which was also posted to the event's Facebook page, Haye said: 'Sorry I can't be there tonight for BAMMA 20, I'm gutted, I'm stuck here in Dubai but I'll be there on June 13 in Birmingham for BAMMA 21.' 'Enjoy the action tonight, it's going to be great.'

{"input": "This gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle, screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The man, known only as Jason, from Vancouver, uploaded the clip to YouTube after his wife filmed the stomach-churning moment. It begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape-sized growth on his wrist. He says: 'We have the pliers, they're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver. 'It should be pretty cool.' The man, known only as Jason, uploaded the video to YouTube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle, a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling . As Jason's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver, he emits loud cries of pain . First, he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible. His sister-in-law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces. She then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth. Sharp cries of pain are heard from Jason with each hit. Astonishingly, though the process seems too agonising to bear, Jason says: 'I think we can go a little deeper'. After one last hammer \u2013 which was once again met with a loud moan \u2013 he says: 'It's in there pretty good. Now we've got to pull it out. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst with a needle, pliers and a screwdriver. He told MailOnline: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It\u2019s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this . 'From a hygiene point of view you\u2019ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that\u2019s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they\u2019re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That\u2019s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we\u2019d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as \"aseptic\", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it\u2019s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.' 'I'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does.' Moments later, he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm. As he squeezes the cyst, sticky, translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea-sized ball. 'Let's see what the consistency looks like,' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers. He adds: 'This is probably the grossest thing I've ever seen \u2013 since the last time I've done this. 'This will probably do the trick for three or so months until I have to pop it again.' Uploading the video to YouTube under the name 'The Wrist Cyst', he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again. Unsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body. Dr Arun Ghosh,\u00a0a private GP in Liverpool, explains that Jason's cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. They are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers. Generally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment. Dr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill. 'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he\u2019ll need to drain it more often.' Traditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added. Dr Ghosh added Jason's method was also not advisable either. He told MailOnline: 'It\u2019s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. It\u2019s unhygienic, you can\u2019t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand. 'From a hygiene point of view you\u2019ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that\u2019s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they\u2019re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.' He removes the needle and squeezes the cyst, and a ball of sticky, see-through jelly-like fluid emerges . Jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth, which doctors explain is synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them . At the end of the video, Jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months. But doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment . If the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure. Dr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we\u2019d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as \"aseptic\", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection.

{"input": "Wladimir Klitschko has confirmed that Tyson Fury will be his next opponent and the unified heavyweight champion says he is ready to travel to England to defend his belts. The IBF, WBA and WBO king ended his seven-year American hiatus by clearly out-pointing Bryant Jennings at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night but it was not the dazzling New York display he had promised on his Stateside return. The American boxing public fell out of love with the 6ft6in Ukrainian back in 2008 when he outpointed Russian Sultan Ibragimov in an uninspiring, lop-sided victory in this very Madison Square Garden ring. And, although seven years and 12 fights have passed since then for Klitschko, it was a case of same ring, same story. The watching Fury, who is mandatory challenger to the champion's WBO belt and in line for a summer showdown, will have been encouraged by the performance. Wladimir Klitschko celebrates after beating Bryant Jennings on Saturday night in New York City . Klitschko was awarded a unanimous victory over Jennings by the judges at Madison Square Garden . The fight against Jennings was Klitschko's first in the United States since he fought Sultan Ibragimov in 2008 . Klitschko has confirmed that Tyson Fury will be his next opponents and is willing to fight him in England . But Klitschko has warned Fury that he will relish finally fighting a man taller than him, after his victory over 6ft3in Jennings. He said: 'I look forward to this fight, I think it will be challenging and exciting because I like to fight big men. It is much easier to fight bigger men than smaller. 'I believe that the fight with Tyson Fury will look different to this one because of the size difference \u2013 Fury is taller than me. He is definitely the guy who is ambitious and I think it is going to be exciting. I think that he is going to engage in the fight. 'There was not much engagement through Jennings today but I think the Fury fight will be exciting and I'm looking forward to it.' The Ukrainian once again used his height and longer reach to dominate has challenger . Klitschko won 116-111 on two of the judges cards and by a margin of 118-109 on the other on Saturday . Klitschko was happy to travel to America to face an American \u2013 and insists he is ready to hit the road again to face the Wythenshawe born Fury. The only confusion appears to be from which governing body the mandatory challenge will come. Fury is No.1 contender for the WBO strap but Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente says the order will actually come from the WBA. Either way, all three of the champion's belts are likely to be on the line. 'We still have to find out when and where the fight will happen but we will sort it out in the next few weeks,' Klitschko added. 'I am absolutely open to fighting anywhere. It depends on negotiations and hopefully we will not need a purse bid.' Victory in Manhattan on Saturday took Klitschko's run of consecutive title defences to 18 and a win against Fury will move him level with Larry Holmes on 19. He remains some way off the record of 25 set by Joe Louis during the 1930s and 40s. He did, however, equal the Bronze Bomber's total of 27 world heavyweight title fights contested at the Garden. The 39-year-old Ukrainian saw off his Philadelphian challenger on points at Madison Square Garden . Brother Vitali watches on as the world heavyweight champion celebrates his victory in America . The 39-year-old wears his WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles with pride after his win . There is no doubting that Klitschko is one of the most dominant champions of any era but it could be argued that there has been a paucity of genuine challengers during his reign. Take Jennings for example. The 30-year-old, a former handyman in the Philadelphia bank, only started boxing six years ago and this was only his 20th professional fight. Indeed, when Jennings first laced them up, Klitschko was already seven defences into his current hot streak. But he put up a good fight here, although on the few occasions he did get inside Klitschko's defence, he was unable to land anything other than single shots. Despite standing three inches shorter than the champion, Jennings enjoyed an incredible three-inch reach advantage, although it was not really a factor in the end. The American struggled to administer his jab and instead relied upon occasional forward raids. Klitschko, as ever, allowed him to move towards him and tied him up. The Ukrainian is often criticised for his persistent holding and he was deducted a point for that in the 10th round here. Hayden Panettiere was in the crowd at Madison Square Garden to watch her fiancee's latest fight . Madison Square Garden, which has hosted some big fights over the years, pictured on Saturday night . Klitshcko's last fight in the United States was in Madison Square Garden in 2008, seven years ago . Despite that, he was awarded the win by a 116-111 on two cards and an ever bigger 118-109 on the other. However, the wide cards belie a unusual vulnerability about Klitschko at times, which was not in keeping with his most recent victories during which his defence has seemed virtually impregnable. Fury would have noticed. The Klitschko brothers have been ruffled by Brits in the past with David Haye infuriating them by wearing a t-shirt depicting him holding the severed heads of the brothers in each hand. Then, before Dereck Chisora fought older brother Vitali, 'Dell Boy' slapped the champion at the weigh-in then spat water in Wladimir's face. Fury, one of British boxing's biggest characters, is known for being outspoken and could attempt to get under Wladimir's skin. However, the 39-year-old said: 'Antics outside of the ring? You know what, who cares about outside of the ring? It's all about what happens inside.'", "answer": "Wladimir Klitschko successfully defends his WBA, IBF and WBO belts .\nWorld heavyweight champion beat Bryant Jennings on points in New York .\nUkrainian awarded 116-111, 118-109, 116-111 unanimous points win .\nMandatory challenger Tyson Fury watched at Madison Square Garden .\nKlitschko ready to travel to England to take on Fury .", "completion": ["Wladimir Klitschko has confirmed that Tyson Fury will be his next opponent and he is ready to travel to England to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion titles."]}

She said: \u2018There\u2019s not many women that can relate to women.

She said: \u2018I don\u2019t necessarily think we should assume that because you\u2019re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. \u2018Just speaking a language they understand \u2013 you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket \u2013 just speaking about everyday problems.\u2019 She said: \u2018Women that I speak to, there\u2019s just nothing there for them to relate to.\u2019 Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband .

You have nightmares. You can\u2019t live a normal live.\u2019 But she said therapy had helped. \u2018I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn\u2019t wear low-cut tops \u2013 no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. \u2018Your body has been taken away from you \u2013 they take your body, you lose control of it. It\u2019s not a good place to be.\u2019 She said she used to have \u2018horrific nightmares\u2019 every night and couldn\u2019t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and \u2018dealing with it\u2019 had transformed her life. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m God\u2019s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I\u2019ve took control of my life \u2013 because that\u2019s what therapy does.\u2019 She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. \u2018It\u2019s just been happy with you. Selfies are a reflection of saying \u201cthis is me, take me as I am\u201d. \u2018This is me taking a selfie \u2013 anyone saying don\u2019t do it, I say just don\u2019t look because this is me.\u2019", "answer": "Karen Danczuk said MPs needed to speak in a language people understood .\nShe said she would like to go into 'mainstream politics' in the future .\nMrs Danczuk said women did not have anything to relate to this election .\nShe also defended her infamous selfies: 'This is me, take me as I am'", "completion": ["Selfie queen Karen Danczuk has expressed her ambition to become an MP, stating that she could relate to ordinary women unlike current female politicians."]}

Hibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton.

{"input": "The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets' droppings and use bins provided (pictured) A London council is to  introduce CSI-style DNA testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who don't clean up after their animals. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal's cheek so it is registered on a database. The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an \u00a380 fine. The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate. The council hopes that the collection of DNA samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in Britain to microchip their dogs by April next year. And while it will mean an expense for the council, they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the US have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent. The move is part of efforts from the council to reduce its \u00a32.3million annual street cleansing bill. Although the methods may seem extreme, Council leader Councillor Darren Rodwell claims they are necessary to clean up the borough. He said: 'We are the first Council in the country to get really tough on dog mess and pet owners who do not act in a socially responsible way. 'The vast majority of dog owners in Barking and Dagenham are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it's ok to not clean up after their pet. 'Dog mess not only spoils our streets \u2013 it's also a health hazard and especially to young children which is why we are using this innovative approach.' The scheme is currently being discussed under the tagline Leading A New Way - but there are no plans as yet to make it mandatory. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Civic Centre pictured, will become the first in the UK to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines . They're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the Kennel Club, Keep Britain Tidy and Streetkleen, the company which will run the DNA testing, on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples. Streetkleen managing director Gary Downie said: 'I believe the combination of DNA testing and enforcement could be the most effective means of ensuring owners are held accountable for their dog's actions. 'In the US, we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme. 'For the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all. 'In fact, we believe that the minimal cost involved in the DNA testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task.'", "answer": "Barking and Dagenham to become first council to DNA test dog mess .\nCouncil could match DNA with sample from mess and fine owners \u00a380 .\nWants to 'encourage' swab registration - which would not be mandatory .\nSchemes in the US have reduced dog fouling as much as 90 per cent .", "completion": ["The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham plans to introduce DNA testing for dogs to track and fine owners who don't clean up after their pets, aiming to reduce its annual street cleansing bill and improve public health."]}

Arshdeep Kaur and her mother Shinder, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India, to visit relatives when a group of about half a dozen men began harassing them. The men grabbed Arshdeep and made several attempts to 'molest' her and her mother, but instead of defending them, the bus staff joined in the sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Victims: Arshdeep Kaur, 14, and her mother Shinder, pictured in hospital, were travelling from their home in Punjab, northern India, \u00a0when passengers and bus staff sexually assaulted them . The incident took place on a near-empty bus near Moga, some 50 miles from the Pakistani border, in Punjab province. Mrs Kaur, 38, daughter Arshdeep, 14, and son Akashdeep Singh, had taken the bus from their home village to visit Mrs Kaur's parents, Tribune India reports. Shortly after boarding the bus, a group of men had surrounded mother and daughter and tried to grab both of them.

Arshdeep and Mrs Kaur both suffered serious injuries, and the 14-year-old later died in hospital. 'No one helped. They first pushed my daughter off the bus, then me,' Mrs Kaur told NDTV\u00a0from her hospital bed today. Shortly after the pair had been pushed off, the bus stopped by the roadside and the alleged perpetrators, including the conductor, cleaner and driver fled the scene. The three could later be apprehended and police have launched an investigation into the incident. There has a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India in recent weeks after officials banned a documentary about the 2012 gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary, called India's Daughter, would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus.

He managed to suss out when both Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden were were fibbing and also appeared in a video clip catching out a cheating husband for lying about an affair. He asked Amanda Holden to conceal a ball and then try and trick him about which hand it was in, but Darren managed to spot her fib straight away. 'I noticed a slight flick on that side of the mouth \u2013 a micro expression,' he said, much to the presenters amazement. Philip Schofield was also caught fibbing, which Darren said he detected by a raised eyebrow. The full-time human lie detector, who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial, then shared his secrets on the This Morning website. How do you tell if someone is telling porkies? 'People might clutch a clipboard, file or coffee cup to their chest, creating a subconscious barrier if they're lying,' he says. 'Or hold it in two hands. Darren knew presenter Amanda Holden was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth, much to the presenters amazement. 'Statistically it's a myth that a liar can't look you in the eye. Three to five seconds of eye contact is normal. Any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing. He also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying. 'Liars don't like being asked for details. If they're not prepared, they'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer,' he explains. 'The greater the consequences, the more signals a liar gives off,' adds, giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake. But according to the lie-sniffing expert people often have an accurate gut instinct about whether those close to them are telling the truth or not. 'The difference is that the techniques I've learned accelerate this process so I can have the same level of rapport and insight with another in seconds,' he explains. But one of the easiest ways to spot a liar is spotting a twitch. Liars often twitch when they are being untruthful,' he says. 'Sometimes it can be a particularly long blink, or it could be a tiny muscle in the cheek or neck. Men in particular have an area at the bottom of their nose that twitches when they are fibbing.'

{"input": "Theresa May warned last night that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws. The Home Secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to update the powers of MI5 and GCHQ, and repair the damage done by the US traitor Edward Snowden. But, based on current polling, Parliament would be left deadlocked \u2013 with the balance of power held by Scottish nationalists opposed to updating the law. Home secretary Theresa May (pictured) warned that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws - adding new legislation for MI5 and GCHQ is urgently needed . She urged wavering Ukip supporters and the four in ten voters who say they are still undecided to realise what is at stake for Britain\u2019s security on May 7. The situation is made especially acute by a \u2018poison pill\u2019 inserted into emergency anti-terror laws passed last year. The legislation lapses next year. And if MPs cannot agree on a replacement, Britain\u2019s spies will be unable to properly track the communications of Islamic State and other terrorists. Mrs May said that, in the worst scenario, the decision would be in the hands of a minority Ed Miliband government propped up by the SNP \u2013 which is opposed to new data retention powers, . Her comments follow a controversial warning by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s SNP \u2013 as the polls say is highly likely. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) said Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Sturgeon\u2019s SNP . Mr Fallon said that, having stabbed his brother in the back to get the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband may now do the same to his country over national security. However Mrs May insists that she is not using counter-terrorism as a \u2018political football\u2019 and the threat is real. She told the Mail: \u2018It is a matter of very real concern to me. There is a concern where we have a hung Parliament where it is difficult to get legislation through or a Labour government that is propped up by the SNP. \u2018Decisions will need to be taken about the capabilities we need and the one party that is committed to ensuring the security agencies and law enforcement have the powers that we need is the Conservative party.\u2019 Mrs May delivered her warning in an exclusive interview with the Mail during a tour of marginal seats in the North and the Midlands.

Mauresmo, who is expecting a baby in August, will be replaced by Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the lead-up to the US Open and quite possibly after that, depending on how she assesses her priorities. The 27-year-old Scot, who is in Munich for this week\u2019s BMW Open and joined in the 100-year celebrations at the Iphitos Tennis Club on Monday night, parted company with Ivan Lendl last year because the Czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling.

Murray (right) poses for a picture alongside WBO Super Middleweight champion Arthur Abraham . Murray made it clear that if the responsibilities of parenthood prevent Mauresmo from fulfilling her 26-week commitment, then their relationship may have to go the same way. \u2018Right now Amelie does all the major competitions but if she doesn\u2019t want to do loads of time, I don\u2019t find it beneficial if someone just comes in for the major competitions and doesn\u2019t do any of the training, any of the other events,\u2019 Murray said. The plan is for Mauresmo to work with him up until Wimbledon, although by then she will be in the latter stages of pregnancy. Murray originally considered Bjorkman as a replacement for Lendl so if their current trial works well, it is likely he will take a more significant role than as an assistant to Mauresmo. It quickly became clear to Murray that the respected Swede might be used in an increased capacity after Mauresmo told him in February that, eight months after they had formalised their agreement, she was expecting \u2014 initially saying she had \u2018something personal\u2019 to tell him. \u2018I thought, \u201cSomething personal to tell you?\u201d I thought maybe she\u2019s pregnant,\u2019 Murray said. \u2018She normally goes to the gym all the time but she didn\u2019t train once through Australia. When she told me, it was a bit of a surprise.

Jonas Bjorkmann (left) will work with Murray until the end of the US Open and then maybe longer . Mauresmo is not in Munich this week for Murray\u2019s first tournament on the clay since he got married. So far everything with Bjorkman has been satisfactory and he joined them in Barcelona last week at a training camp. \u2018He\u2019s easy going but as a player he was mentally very strong and had a great work ethic,\u2019 Murray said. \u2018I see him as being a good fit personality-wise but you don\u2019t really get the whole package until you\u2019re playing matches and there\u2019s a bit more pressure and stress.

Only 500 were on general sale with the rest\u00a0distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. One fan, Ade Adebayo, 34, from Brighton was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket when they were released last week and here he tells us his story and his hopes for the fight. I booked the trip to Las Vegas back on December 13. One of my friends, Toby, was convinced the fight was going to happen and we needed to book it before it was announced and the prices sky-rocketed. So we booked it and waited for the announcement. Christmas and New Year came and went and the fight was not announced. Then it looked like it was going to be announced during half-time of the Super Bowl. It didn't happen. Then we thought it was going to be announced during the NBA All-Star game. It wasn't. Ade Adebayo (second right) and friends at Gatwick before jetting off to Las Vegas . Ade and his friends booked their trip to Las Vegas back in December in anticipation for the big fight . The email confirmation that showed Ade had bought a ticket for the biggest fight . But eventually it was announced late one Friday in February and we could not believe it was finally going to happen. Even though we had our flights and hotel booked we were not sure if we were going to be able to get tickets as we thought that hardly any would be released and they would be sold to the big companies for the most amount of money. We thought the whole thing was being orchestrated to make the most amount of money possible. But all four of us had been to Vegas before and we always said that if we were to go again then it would have to be for a big event or fight like this, so we thought it was worth going even if we didn't get a ticket. One of my friends in the group had been in Vegas for both Ricky Hatton vs Floyd Mayweather and Hatton vs Manny Pacquiao. He said it would be insane and that we had to go. Then it was announced last week that a limited number of tickets would go on sale at 8pm on Thursday night. We all agreed to try and get tickets. But my problem was I going to fit camp with my\u00a0mum on Thursdays and it was the last one, and if I didn't go then she wouldn't go, and I am trying to encourage her. So we went to the gym and I was looking at the clock the whole time. We did the session and the warm-down and at 7.55pm I sprinted out of the gym and into the car and was trying to get online while in the car. We drove to my mum's house and by the time I got there it was 8.09pm and I got the laptop out and went on to the Ticketmaster website. Ade and friends are staying at The\u00a0Cosmopolitan on the Vegas strip overlooking the famous fountain in front of the\u00a0Bellagio hotel . I put in for four tickets. None available. I tried three. None available. Two and then one, same thing. I kept trying and trying and was changing the price bracket and number of tickets and then at 8.15pm I got through and it said on the screen that I had one ticket. I was stunned. It was $7,924.40 (\u00a35,141.68) But I realised I was on my business partner's laptop and it did not have all my credit card details saved as mine does. So I had to sprint out of the house to my car to try and find my card and race back, by the time I got back to the laptop and put in my details there was about 45 seconds left on the countdown timer. In panic when I was filling everything in I clicked the box for insurance and ended up paying an extra $455. I'm not even sure what it is insurance for!

Ade and his friends are planning a trip to the Hollywood hills in the days before the big fight . The group plan to head back to Vegas via Death Valley and the Nevada desert . Then it was all confirmed and I thought it was all too easy, and had I really managed to get a ticket? Or was it a scam and had I been turned over for just over \u00a35,000? But then an email came through from Ticketmaster and I could not believe I had managed to get one. I then went on to our group WhatsApp group and just wrote 'I got a ticket' and the phone just went mad with messages asking to see a screen shot. And when I sent it everyone just went mad, no one could believe it. My business partner, Neil, has been on Twitter and he thinks he may have tracked down a ticket in the row behind me and the person may be willing to sell it, so we may possibly have two tickets. We will see. The group plan a big night out on Friday on the famous Las Vegas strip . The Wet Republic pool party at the MGM Grand is on the agenda for Saturday . We flew out from Gatwick on Wednesday and we're staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel just down the Strip from the MGM Grand. After a 'quiet' night on Wednesday, we are going on a road trip to LA and the Hollywood Hills. We are spending one night there and then coming back to Vegas on Friday via the sights of Death Valley and the Nevada desert. We'll have a big night out on Friday and then chill out on Saturday at the Wet Republic Pool Party at the MGM hosted by DJ Calvin Harris. And then it is fight night! Carl Froch beat George Groves in front of 80,000 fans at Wembely Stadium . Ade had good seats for the Froch vs Groves fight at Wembley in May last year . Mark Wright and James Argent were two of the 'celebrities' at the Froch vs Groves fight - but A-listers are expected to be in attendance at the MGM Grand on Saturday night . I have been to big events in the past, I was at Carl Froch vs George Groves at Wembley and we had good seats for that. We saw people from The Only Way Is Essex, Gordon Ramsey and Andros Townsend. But Vegas is going to be the REAL A-list. I have had some good trips in the past as well, a friend of mine is Richard Branson's PA and she invited me to his island a few years ago, so I've spent a few days chilling out there, it was insane. I never thought that holiday would be topped. Ade will be one of 16,000 fans who will pack into the MGM Garden Arena on Saturday night . Floyd Mayweather will face Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight in boxing history . But already this trip promises to be amazing, the atmosphere in Vegas will be amazing ahead of the fight, everyone will be buzzing. In terms of the fight, I would like to see Manny Pacquiao win.

Goggles that could help the blind see have come a step closer to reality. The technology is based on a technique known as 'neuromodulation' in which electricity stimulates the nervous system to restore sight. A surgeon first implants a small silicon chip with 150 electrodes on the retina. When the patient puts on the system's dark glasses, an integrated video camera sends images to a portable computer. A connected 'pocket processor' converts that recording into an infrared image, which the goggles will then beam into the eye. Pulses activate electrodes in the implant, and the optic nerve carries images to the brain. Retinal implants that restore some sight when in the blind are already available, but their quality isn't good enough to work in many real-world conditions. Pixium Vision's solution, however, claims it has been able to restore the sight of rats to a level equivalent to 20/250. This would allow the wearer to see the largest line of letters in an opticians test. The company claims it may be able to get its final product to restore vision to 20/120, which would be a huge leap forward in vision quality. Second Sight, the company that got FDA approval for the first visual prosthesis two years ago, currently offers patients about 20/1300 vision.

{"input": "Many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of Marvel's Tony Stark, but we can now at least get his trademark hi-tech gloves at home. Laser expert\u00a0Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as\u00a0AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside. A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall.

Prices are not known.\u00a0The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and it can be made for either the left or right hand, or both . The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a \u2018pain in the a\u2019 to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fr\u00f6be) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. \u2018That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,\u2019 said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is \u2018strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,\u2019 she said. \u2018There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn\u2019t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.\u2019 None of this would work, though, without Stark\u2019s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.", "answer": "Iron Man-style arm and hand was built by laser expert Patrick Priebe .\nIt fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm .\nIn a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches .\nGadget is powered by Lithium-ion cells and can be ordered from Mr Priebe .", "completion": ["Laser expert Patrick Priebe has created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm, capable of popping balloons and lighting matches from a distance."]}
{"input": "After experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the April 25 earthquake, Nepal was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of \u2018beef masala\u2019 as part of the relief package from Pakistan. Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu\u2019s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of \u2018beef masala\u2019 were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors \u2013 drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) \u2014 are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. \u201cWhen we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of \u2018beef masala\u2019.

Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. \u201cWe did not touch the Pakistani aid,\u201d Dr Singh said. \u201cMost of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,\u201d said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: \u201cPakistan has hurt Nepal\u2019s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.\u201d Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the \u2018beef masala\u2019 packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include \u2018potato bhujia\u2019 and \u2018beef masala\u2019. A top Nepal government official said: \u201cThe matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.\u201d Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: \u201cI am not aware of the issue\u2026I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.\u201d Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: \u201c(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks\u2026.\u201d Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan\u2019s NDMA. \u201cPANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,\u201d the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one\u2019s mother. In Nepal \u2014 for long the world\u2019s only Hindu state \u2014 the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: \u201cThis kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.\u201d It trumpeted Nepal as the \u2018purest Hindu kingdom\u2019 and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. \u201cIf people die, then who will vote?\u201d the court asked. \u201cThey are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?\u201d the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the \u2018apron area\u2019 of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. \u201cDGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It\u2019s scary,\u201d a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. \u201cThe team didn\u2019t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,\u201d a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. \u201cEven then, the rescue team members didn\u2019t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,\u201d a senior immigration official said. \u201cThey had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn\u2019t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,\u201d a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: \u201cNo one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.\u201d The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.", "answer": "Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .\nKilling a cow used to be punishable by death, but now carries a 12-year jail term .\nNepalese government officials have informed the country's PM .\nAn internal inquiry is underway and the matter will be raised with Pakistan .", "completion": ["Nepal, a majority-Hindu country where cows are sacred, received packets of 'beef masala' as part of a relief package from Pakistan following the April 25 earthquake, potentially causing diplomatic tension between the two countries."]}
{"input": "Rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to Earth from a gigantic fireball that lit up the skies over Britain and Ireland, experts say. The fireball was captured on camera on Sunday by the United Kingdom Meteor Observing Network (UKMON) in Portadown, County Armagh. Footage shows it glowing brightly as it races northwards towards the Irish Sea. Scroll down for videos . The fireball was captured on camera on Sunday by the United Kingdom Meteor Observing Network (UKMON) in Portadown, County Armagh . UKMON said that pieces from the meteorite, which came from an asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter, would have crashed to Earth and could potentially be worth thousands of pounds. David Moore from Astronomy Ireland told The Mirror: 'This event was so bright that a piece or pieces may have survived the re-entry and landed as extremely rare and valuable meteorites.' However, the group's initial analysis of its trajectory, based on the 50 sightings that were reported to it, suggests that it may well have fallen into the Irish Sea. UKMON said: 'It is very likely something has survived and landed in the Irish Sea. Probably no bigger than 30 to 50 grams.' It added that the meteorite was burning at a very low altitude of \u00a021 miles, compared to the usual 50 to 75 miles and was formed of 'very hard and dense material compared to soft cometary material which we normally see as meteor showers'. The network is appealing for members of the public to report eyewitness accounts of the event. It comes after astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor triggered the conversion of biblical figure Paul, one of the most influential figures in early Christianity, . Experts believe the bright light in the sky that blinded him for three days match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013. Dr William Hartmann, co-founder of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, examined three accounts of Paul's conversion in the Bible. Astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia (pictured) triggered the conversion of biblical figure Paul . The fireball above Chelyabinsk (above) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars . Writing in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, he said: 'The first-century book, Acts of the Apostles, gives three separate descriptions of a bright light \"from heaven\", which occurred probably in the 30s (C.E.) near Damascus, Syria. 'The details offer a strikingly good match to a Chelyabinsk-class or Tunguska-class fireball.' In the accounts given in the Bible, Paul had been one of the zealous persecutors of the followers of Jesus. However, during a journey to Damascus, Syria, he and his companions saw a bright light in the sky. Paul was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound. The experience apparently so affected Paul that he converted to Christianity and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of Christ around the Mediterranean. Many believe Paul's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the Roman and Protestant faith strands that exist today. However, some have attempted to explain Paul's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke. Dr Hartmann, however, says the description of the light in the sky, the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite. He said the Cheyabinsk meteor, which exploded in the atmosphere close to the Russian city, is a good example of what Paul may have experienced. He said that the bright light in the sky - which was 'brighter than the sun, shining round me' - matches videos of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. Its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around Paul.", "answer": "Fireball captured on camera by the UK Meteor Observing Network .\nIt says that it came from an asteroid orbiting between Mars and Jupiter .\nThe meteor burned up at the relatively low altitude of 21 miles .\nThere were dozens of sightings of the event, from England to Ireland .", "completion": ["Rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to Earth from a fireball that lit up the skies over Britain and Ireland, with experts suggesting that pieces from the meteorite could potentially be worth thousands of pounds."]}
{"input": "Britain's intelligence agencies have been ordered to destroy information they got illegally by spying on confidential communications between a Libyan dissident and his lawyers, a watchdog has ruled. GCHQ, the Government\u2019s listening post, unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi \u2013 even though the legally-privileged material was protected by strict rules. In a landmark ruling yesterday, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services, ordered spies to destroy two copies of the sensitive eavesdropped communications. Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham. The Government\u2019s listening post unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi, it has been ruled . GCHQ confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi (pictured) and his lawyer . Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime. But the IPT said the dissident should not receive compensation for breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to private and family life. Intelligence chiefs sparked fury in February by admitting that they had unlawfully listened in to lawyer-client communications even though they are generally covered by 'legal professional privilege' to protect privacy and the right to a free trial. Now GCHQ has confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi and his lawyer. The IPT rejected similar claims by other Libyan claimants including Abdel Hakim Belhadj, another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner. Britain has already paid Mr al-Saadi \u00a32.2million compensation after he took legal action over MI6's role in his abduction, imprisonment and mistreatment by Libya. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK. It has not been disclosed what type of material the two documents contained or when they were recorded but they are likely to be transcripts of telephone conversations secretly intercepted by GCHQ. Last night Mr al-Saadi said: \u2018I had always been told I had a right to communicate with my lawyers about this torture case in private, but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case. Tony Blair with former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\u00a0Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime . \u2018This was illegal behaviour and I hope now that the right to take legal advice in private will never be ignored again.\u2019 Richard Stein, his solicitor, said: \u2018GCHQ unlawfully spied on privileged legal communications for years, and the secret oversight mechanisms failed to stop it. \u2018This marks the end of GCHQ\u2019s standard boilerplate response that its activities are lawful, necessary and proportionate. I am sure that the unlawful behaviour we have uncovered in this case is the tip of the iceberg.\u2019 Cori Crider, of legal charity Reprieve, which represented the families, said: \u2018GCHQ spied on privileged legal communications, in a case where they were being sued by a rendition and torture victim. \u2018We are pleased that one man has finally beaten the security services in this secretive tribunal. But this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child\u2019s play, because it rigs the whole justice game in the government\u2019s favour.\u2019 The IPT's ruling said that two documents involving al-Saadi \u2018contained material subject to the legal professional privilege\u2026 held by GCHQ\u2019. It added: \u2018In order to emphasise the importance of the protection of legally privileged material the tribunal has required GCHQ to give an undertaking that the parts of the documents containing legally privileged information will be destroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future.\u2019 The IPT rejected similar claims to Mr al Saadi's made by other Libyan claimants, including Abdel Hakim Belhadj (pictured), another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner . Mr al Saadi was kidnapped with his family in Hong Kong in 2004, and tortured after his rendition to Libya following what he claims was a tip-off by MI6. He was eventually freed and returned to Britain where he began legal action against the Government. In December 2012 Britain agreed to pay Mr al Saadi \u00a32 million in compensation in an out of court settlement. However, the Government did not admit liability for the rendition to Libya in 2004, nor confirm that MI6 was involved. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK over the same scandal. He insists he was tortured during six horrific years in jail, including being beaten and hung from hooks on the walls. The former Islamist rebel, now a prominent politician in Tripoli, has spurned a seven-figure settlement and wants an admission of guilt and an apology from Britain. Last October, the Court of Appeal heard claims that the British Government under Tony Blair was complicit in the arrest of Mr Belhadj and his wife at Bangkok airport in 2004. His legal battle raises the extraordinary prospect of Mr Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy, being hauled before the courts to give evidence. A Government spokesman said: \u2018We welcome the tribunal's confirmation today that the intelligence agencies did not seek or gain any advantage in legal proceedings and, in fact, held no information referring to any legal advice relating to the claimants.\u2019", "answer": "Sami al-Saadi's  communications with his lawyer were illegally intercepted .\nThe Investigatory Powers Tribunal overseeing the security services has ordered spies to destroy two copies of the eavesdropped communications .\nMr al-Saadi claims the British Government was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to Libya to be tortured by the Gadaffi regime .", "completion": [" "]}

Before you would see quite a bit of him round here. But we don\u2019t see nearly as much of him now as we used to.\u2019 It may be a conscious thing. Google the words \u2018Leigh Griffiths and controversy\u2019 in the same search and there are more answers than pubs on Leith Walk. In football people talk and older, wiser colleagues and managers whispered of a player with a reputation for being unmanagable. \u2018There was never any doubt about the boy\u2019s ability,\u2019 says former Dundee manager Gordon Chisholm. \u2018It was the off-field stuff that concerned you. He was a young boy when I had him. He was quiet, withdrawn at times, and wasn\u2019 t exactly the life and soul of the dressing room. \u2018He kept himself to himself - but he couldn\u2019t get back to Edinburgh quick enough. \u2018That seemed to be the case any time he got a day off. Any spare time and he wanted back to Leith to be with his mates, which probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. 'I\u2019m not sure he was doing the right kind of things. I\u2019m sure he is now being guided by the Celtic management team.\u2019 It has taken time, work and effort to get to a point where Griffiths can now boast 14 goals in his last 17 games. Griffiths celebrated his hat-trick with a trophy as he became Celtic's top scorer . Griffiths caused a stir when he first arrived at Hibernian but proved to be a fans favourite in the end . Griffiths celebrates scoring the winning goal for Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2013 . As a child, he stood out in Edinburgh amateur football. But concerns about the impact of his formative years on the company he kept prompted Hibs, his boyhood idols, to reject his talents. \u2018It\u2019s well known he could be a feisty character,\u2019 recalls Tam Currie, a Leith Athletic committee member. \u2018I go back with Leigh to when he was 12 and he was a lad who had to be looked after. \u2018He came from a split family and you take on the role of social worker in that situation. But he was no different from the others in that regard. \u2018He was like any other young lad. He had his troubles with different folk and what not.\u2019 \u2018Troubles with different folk\u2019 is a polite way of summing up his career. Boldly, Neil Lennon took a gamble on signing him for \u00a3900,000 in January 2014. Celtic supporters were underwhelmed. Griffiths had accumulated yet more front-page cuttings from while on loan at Hibernian from Wolverhampton Wanderers following a racism row on social media. The doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to Leith \u2013 where else? \u2013 to attend an Edinburgh derby as a Hibs fan. He was in a pub where offensive chants about Hearts and former Tynecastle attacker Rudi Skacel were filmed and posted on the internet. In October, he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football. When the legal action is concluded one way or the other the SFA will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute. Griffiths was Wolves leading goalscorer in January of last year, scoring 13 goals in all . That attracted interest from Celtic though, with the Scottish striker penning a four-year deal with the Bhoys . The potential for embarrassment to Celtic is apparent and, perhaps for that reason, Lennon\u2019s successor, Ronny Deila, appeared to make a judgement the player wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. He was no one\u2019s definition of a Deila 24-hour athlete. Yet the Norwegian\u2019s attitudes to Griffiths began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for Celtic\u2019s development team against Sunderland of his own accord. Within days he was back in the first team, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice. In the five months since, he has usurped John Guidetti in the starting XI and is now regarded as Deila\u2019s most potent attacker. \u2018He looks as if he has matured as a player,\u2019 adds Chisholm, now a scout with Sunderland. \u2018He never wanted to be an out-and-out striker when I had him at Dundee. He always drifted out into wide areas. \u2018He still does that, but I think he has improved. His hold-up play and movement is better. \u2018He is playing with good quality players, getting better service and I am hopeful he has turned a corner now.\u2019 Bolton and Hibs wanted Griffiths on loan in the last window.

There were certainly a few doubters there. \u2018People here in this neck of woods was hoping he would end up back at Hibs on loan. \u2018I\u2019m delighted for him it didn\u2019t come to that because I don\u2019t think it would have been a good move for his career. \u2018To be honest, I would take him over Steven Fletcher every time. \u2018He is a better striker. I used to see Fletcher a lot when he played for Hibs and, all round, Leigh is a better player. \u2018I read he still has a trial to go through for the pub incident - but he knows now he has to be on his best behaviour. You have to be to be a Celtic player. \u2018I\u2019ll tell him that if I see him again in Leith.

'I still idolise her poise, body and skin to this day and I practiced in my mother's heels back and forth in the kitchen. I'm honored that the plus fashion world calls me the \"Naomi of Plus\" because she's taught me from afar unknowingly.' Liris, 32,  is now dubbed The Body and The Naomi Campbell of plus - but it wasn't always so simple . Liris' model idol has always been Naomi Campbell, right, who she 'obsessed over' as a young girl and is now compared to by industry bigwigs . When she was starting out, despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape, but now she stars in regular fashion shoots, pictured . In her junior year of high school, she heard about a casting call in her area for a convention called Model Search America and immediately signed up. She was lucky enough to get callbacks from Zoli Models, Elite Models NY, Michelle Pommier and Seventeen Magazine - but there was a catch. 'They all loved me but wanted me to lose weight,' she said. Despite being a healthy size 10 (US 6), Liris received rejection after rejection due to her voluptuous shape. And even though she chose an east coast giant, Wilhelmina Models, as her mother agency, casting reps still requested that she first lose weight and then come back in six months. Liris has also starred in top videos with Jennifer Lopez, Jay Z and Puff Daddy . Liris is breaking into the UK and appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's Evans, and starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand . Instead of giving into their demands or giving up on what she believed was her calling, Liris, who is 5ft 11in, and now size 18 (US 14), took matters into her own hands and created the vision for them. She became her own agent and utilised the urban market to achieve her dreams with the help of her agency. Liris began to spread like wildfire. Essence, Honey, XXL, The Source and Black Elegance magazines were the first to believe in her vision. With these successes, Glamour, Seventeen and Girl soon caught onto her refreshing image and began requesting Liris for their glossy pages. She booked top videos for the likes of Jennifer Lopez,  Jay Z, Puff Daddy, starred on MTV and landed  film roles. Liris says she wants to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion . And now she's starting to break the UK. Liris appeared in a recent campaign for Sir Philip Green's plus-size fashion retailer, Evans, who fell in love with her when she took her runway reign to British Plus Size Fashion Weekend 2014. She has also starred in the Goddess Lingerie line through the Eveden brand. 'I would love to work more in the UK with Evans, Anna Scholz, Yours Clothing, Panache, Elomi, ASOS, Simple Be, Dorothy Perkins, Carma Koma to name a few,' she said. 'I want to continue to change the industry by inspiring women to follow their dreams, helping to represent a different body type other than straight size in mainstream fashion like I have done through my work and to also represent for the black plus woman who feels she doesn't see herself in mainstream fashion and entertainment.'

The Hammers started the season strongly and looked a good bet for European qualification around Christmas before their form fell away, with a mid-table finish now all-but certain. But a reprieve could be granted by the Fair Play League, with Allardyce\u2019s side topping the Barclays Premier League table for their good behaviour, just ahead of Burnley. If West Ham finish top of the pile and England\u2019s top flight is within the top three \u2018fair-playing\u2019 leagues in Europe \u2013 which it was on last count - they will earn a Europa League place.

Manchester City . 5. Southampton . Qualification via Fair Play would see the Hammers enter the competition at the first qualifying round, playing their first game on July 2 and competing in up to six games before the Premier League season even starts.

One in it and one out of it, and obviously if we\u2019re in it we\u2019re back earlier, a few days earlier. If we\u2019re out of it (the Europa League) we come back on July 1, which is one of the smallest close seasons we\u2019ve had in a long time. \u2018And even then international players won\u2019t be back on that date, either earlier or on the first of July because they won\u2019t be finished international duties until the middle of June.\u2019 Aaron Cresswell (left) and Mark Noble (right) could be playing Europa League football next season .

Allardyce hopes that run of misfortune will end at the Etihad Stadium. \u2018It\u2019s been a terrible thing for our results in terms of points to performances in general,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve got to make sure that we focus and if we\u2019re in that position again (leading late on), don\u2019t show the type of nerves we showed last week. \u2018I think we got exceedingly nervous in the last few minutes and made basic mistakes which kept allowing a bit of pressure and Stoke took advantage of it.\u2019", "answer": "Sam Allardyce's West Ham are top of the Premier League Fair Play table .\nThe Upton Park outfit could be playing Europa League football next year .\nAllardyce has said he's happy to sneak\u00a0through the \u2018back door\u2019 into Europe .\nWest Ham travel to league champions Manchester City on Sunday .", "completion": ["West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is open to qualifying for European football via the Fair Play League, despite the team's mid-table finish, as they currently top the Barclays Premier League table for good behaviour."]}

{"input": "Sweeping is a tedious task but now a new \u2018smart bin\u2019 could help save you from all that bending down with a dust pan. The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner. Using sensors on the front of the bin, it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush, turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess. The Bruno Smartcan (pictured) uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it can activate its integrated vacuum. It also has an integrated bag store and charging cord . Bruno comes with an integrated bag dispenser that additionally sends alerts to a smartphone when the owner is getting low on bags, and it can send reminders when it is time to take out the rubbish. Developed by inventors Jim Howard and Lori Montag, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the bin is able to clean up dog hair and spilt breakfast cereal and crumbs, sucking it up directly into the bin bag. It is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain, glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs. Scientists  have developed a \u2018self-cleaning\u2019 coating that can be sprayed  onto materials. The substance, made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, works because it is very, very water resistant. Any moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away, cleaning up dust in its path. The breakthrough, by chemists at University College London, comes after years of research into highly water-resistant - or \u2018superhydrophobic\u2019 - substances. It also features a motion sensitive hands-free lid that opens automatically. The inventors said: \u2018Bruno and its patents pending technologies have been many months in the making. \u2018The powerful vortex vacuum feature will deliver every dog hair, cheerio and grain of dirt directly into the trash bag. \u2018No more stopping, no more scooping, just place the broom in front of the vacuum inlet to start the suction and Bruno will do the rest. \u2018Bruno will also remind you to take the trash out on trash day, and alert you when you are low on Bruno Bags.\u2019 The pair is hoping to attract support for their invention on Kickstarter.

During the flyby, the probe got more than it bargained for as Hyperion unleashed a burst of charged particles towards the spacecraft, effectively delivering a giant 200-volt electric shock. It appears that Hyperion's surface becomes electrostatically charged as it is bathed in charged particles. These particles are constantly streaming out into space from the sun, but Hyperion also has to deal with ones trapped within the magnetic field of its host planet, Saturn. While astronomers expected many bodies throughout the solar system to be charged, the Cassini data represents the first-ever experience of a charged natural object in space other than our moon.

{"input": "A coroner has slammed the ease with which illegal drugs can be ordered over the 'dark web' after two student brothers died consuming ecstasy they had bought online. Astrophysics undergraduate Torin Lakeman, 19, died alongside his brother Jacques, 20, in a pub in Manchester after consuming six times the lethal dose of MDMA after ordering the drug via the web. At Bolton Coroner's Court today, Alan Walsh said he would be contacting Home Secretary Theresa May over the deaths, adding that it was unacceptable that 'intellectual people are able to access drugs in this way.' Torin Lakeman, 19 (left), and brother Jacques, 20 (right), died in a pub in Manchester after consuming ecstasy they had bough from an anonymous dealer via the 'dark web' The brothers were found dead in a room above this pub after going to watch Manchester United play a game against Hull at Old Trafford in December last year . The brothers, both from the Isle of Man, were found in a hotel room above\u00a0The Grapes Pub in Bolton on 1st December last year after travelling to watch Manchester United play at Old Trafford. The court was told that Torin, a student of Physics and Planetary studies at Aberystwyth University, had bought MDMA from website\u00a0Agora from an anonymous seller with the 'handle' Stone Island. Torin's housemate Ethan Bradley said he bought the drugs to 'have a good weekend', and that he would use the drug recreationally, but was not addicted to it. Coroner\u00a0Alan Walsh today said he was concerned at the ease with which the boys bought the lethal drugs, adding he would be writing to the Home Secretary . Jacques was living in\u00a0Chingford,\u00a0London, at the time with his grandmother while training to be a chef, so travelled to meet Torin in Manchester, where the pair booked into the pub for the weekend. The hearing was told that both brothers had taken the drug on separate occasions. The pair watched as Manchester United won their match against Hull 3-0, and father Raymond Lakeman said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together. He said: 'They were brothers so they had fallings out but on the whole they got on as best friends. 'They wanted to go and watch Manchester United play Hull City. I booked the tickets and sent them over with two football shirts for them. 'It was the first time they had ever done anything together like this. They didn't know anybody in Manchester. They were looking forward to seeing each other. 'My wife and I were happier than we had been for weeks and months and years.' Landlord William Pilkington later saw them in the bar and when asked whether they appeared to be drunk, he said they were 'on something else'. Detective Inspector Joanne Clawson from Greater Manchester Police said CCTV from a local shop caught them buying two bottles of WKD and a packet of chewing gum which they took back to their hotel. The alcohol was never consumed. Torin was the last to be seen when he came down from their room at around 9.30pm to ask for the pub's WIFI password. Both of the boys' bodies were found on Monday morning, when pub worker Michael Lawrence went to clean the room they had been staying in. Bolton Coroner's Court was told that\u00a0Jacques, along with his brother Torin, had both consumed the drug before on separate occasions (pictured, Jacques alongside an unknown friend) The court heard that Torin (pictured left, with a friend) bought the drugs via website\u00a0Agora which cannot be accessed through regular websites, before travelling to Manchester to meet his brother . Mr Lawrence told the inquest: 'I went into room five and saw one of the males on the floor in the room. At that stage I didn't see the other one. 'My colleague went into the room and found the body of the other male in this was on the far side of the bed that would have been hidden from view. Ray Lakeman, the boys' father, said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together, and even bought shirts for the pair . 'I was asked to check by police whether there was any evidence of tablets or drugs or anything untoward and I didn't see anything.' A post mortem on Jacques body found he had 6.15mg of MDMA per litre of blood in his body - almost six times the 'lethal' amount of 1.7mg. He also had 229mg of alcohol in his blood - almost three times the drink drive limit. His brother Torin was found to have 7.08mg of ecstasy in his body, while his blood alcohol levels were lower at 87mg. Pathologist Dr Patrick Ward told the inquest: 'If a person is not used it on a regular basis the impact may be greater. In batches of any drug there are different levels of toxicity. 'They could have taken the same amount but the concentration could have been different. I would anticipate they took the same amounts each.' Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Walsh said: 'They had a great day which makes the tragedy of these deaths even harder to accept. 'There was concern as to the quality and quantity of ecstasy in terms of concentration and that may well have been a factor in terms of the ultimate impact. 'They were likely to be tablet form but when they were taken and where taken is unknown. MDMA is known as ecstasy and I accept there were sufficient quantities in the blood to cause death.' He added: ' I accept the drugs were obtained by use of the internet and the drugs delivered to him from an unknown source by use of the internet on the dark web. 'I am concerned about the ability of young people to obtain elicit substances using the internet. 'I am well aware that is a global problem and little can be done to avoid this supply line being used. The death of Jacques and Torin identify a great problem - the dark web. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr\u00a0Walsh said the issue of the dark web concerned him 'as a father and a grandfather' (pictured, Torin Lakeman) 'The dark web identified an anonymous supplier and the supplier exists behind the veil - a confidential and sophisticated veil. 'In the case of Jacques and Torin I hear reference to Stone Island and reference to Agora. I believe these matter should be reported to the Home Secretary. 'Young people have a natural ability these days with regard interned who find it much easier to access these dark sites and have available to them supply of drugs by simply ordering on the internet and delivering to address.

The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that 35-year-old Angelika Graswald, of Poughkeepsie, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 46-year-old Vincent Viafore.

{"input": "Since Herman Melville penned his novel Moby Dick more than 150 years ago, scientists have been fascinated by the remarkable attributes of the sperm whale and its kin - the smaller pygmy and dwarf whales. Now, fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago, have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales. The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the organ involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale\u2019s evolution. Fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales.\u00a0This image shows the right lateral view of the skull of Nanokogia isthmia . Although why this is so remains a mystery. While many whales, dolphins and porpoises have a long fossil record, enabling scientists to understand their evolution, there is limited evidence of sperm whales and smaller pygmy and dwarf whales, which are capable of navigating the ocean deep underwater. Now an international team of scientists, led by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County has discovered a new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale, called Nanokogia isthmia, which clarifies key aspects of the evolution of these  animals. The  well-preserved skulls of two individuals were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama. The find will help experts fill in gaps in the evolution of cetaceans.\u00a0This is the evolutionary tree of sperm whales showing links between extinct and living species, and when the spermaceti organ changed shape . The remains, which were discovered in Panama, indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the evolution of the sperm whale. In contrast modern sperm whales (a stock image is shown) are much larger than their extinct relatives . The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It's only one of three living species in the sperm whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale. Mature males reach an average length of 52 ft (16 metres) with their head making up one third of their length. They mostly dine on squid and swim to depths of 7,380 FT (2,250 metres) to hunt for prey. They are the second deepest diving mammal, following only Cuvier's beaked whale. The sperm whale's clicking vocalisation - a form of echolocation and communication - can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater, making it the loudest sound produced by any animal. It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's and can live for more than 60 years. It reveals an unexpected level of complexity in the evolution of the spermaceti, which is an organ located within the head that plays a key role in the generation of sound and in the whale\u2019s capacity for echolocation. The study, published in the journal Plos One, shows that at one time small sperm whales measuring  around seven feet (two metres in length) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size than  modern day relatives. It got downsized at least twice during their evolutionary history, including the evolutionary event that gave origin to the living pygmy and dwarf sperm whales. Lead researcher Dr Jorge Velez-Juarbe said: \u2018The new discovery gives us a better understanding of the ancient distribution of these poorly known relatives of the sperm whale. \u2018Previously we knew of similarly-aged pygmy and dwarf whales from Baja California and Peru, but this new fossil fills in an important geographic gap in the group\u2019s ancient distribution.\u2019 He added: 'Our study is part of a larger scientific effort aimed at understanding the changes in the marine habitats that resulted from the complete closure of the Isthmus of Panama,' referring to the separation between the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea that took place sometime within the last 10 million years. The new fossil is known from the well-preserved skulls of two individuals which were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama, shown on this map .

{"input": "At half-time, everything pointed to another humiliating English defeat in Dublin. Such was the control Leinster had been able to exert on Bath in an utterly one-sided first half punctuated only by a single piece of individual brilliance by fly-half George Ford, it was impossible to see a way back into the contest for the West Countrymen. Outmuscled at the breakdown, bullied in the scrum and laboured in the line-out, Bath were in danger of going down every bit as tamely as England had a month ago. Bath fly half George Ford ghosts past Leinster full-back Rob Kearney on his way to fine individual score at the Aviva Stadium . The England No 10's solo-try was the only score that the West Country outfit managed to register in the first-half . By the end, remarkably, the three-time champions Leinster were hanging on for dear life as wave after wave of Bath attack threatened to deliver one of the great European comebacks. They fell short, but there was pride to be taken in this. Driven on by their pocket general Ford, Bath somehow came within a whisker of finding a way into the last four. Had it not been for a penalty conceded by replacement Matt Garvey with seconds on the clock, they may well have won. \u2018There\u2019s a lot of disappointment,\u2019 said Bath head coach Mike Ford. \u2018Certainly in the second half we are a lot better than the first. We\u2019re so disappointed because we are a lot better than we showed today, especially in the first half. Ford is congratulated by Bath substitutes Sam Burgess (left) and\u00a0Max Lahiff following his touchdown . Kearney is taken out in the air by Anthony Watson leading to the full-back being dispatched to the sin-bin for 10 minutes . \u2018But it doesn\u2019t dent our belief in what we\u2019re doing. It reinforces it. We lost the game in the first half but I believe that will make us stronger. I\u2019m proud of the boys, but we\u2019ll be even more gutted when we watch the video. It comes down to small margins and I thought the penalty at the end was a dead-set penalty to us.\u2019 He would say that, of course. But his sentiment was correct and Ford insisted his team will retain their determination to attack for the remainder of the Aviva Premiership season. Fly-half Ford was exceptional. Rarely making a false move, dragging his side along with some intelligent kicking, brave distribution and a sharp eye for the gap. His first-half try was a masterpiece of fly-half play as he took the ball flat to line, flashed a dummy and scooted through a non-existent gap before rounding full-back Rob Kearney to score. Bath lock Stuart Hooper crashes over for his side's second try following another dazzling break from Ford . But despite his 21st-minute moment of brilliance, it looked for all the world as if Leinster would repeat Ireland\u2019s Six Nations strangulation of England as Bath\u2019s discipline failed under the pressure of Leinster\u2019s superior set-piece and domination at the breakdown. That impression was compounded when Bath full-back Anthony Watson, one of four visiting players who only a month ago suffered Six Nations heartache on the same Aviva Stadium pitch, spent 10 minutes in the sin-bin for a reckless aerial challenge on Kearney. Referee Jerome Garces showed Watson a yellow card, despite the shameful pleas by three Leinster players for him to be shown red, and Leinster centre Ian Madigan kicked two more penalties in his absence to send his side in 15-5 up at half-time and seemingly in complete control. Ian Madigan was in imperious kicking form as the Leinster centre fired over six penalties . But Bath showed their mettle with a wonderful second-half revival. Despite their disappointment at failing to progress, Bath should take enormous confidence in knowing that with more precision they could, should even, have won this game. Their determination to put width on the ball and play at high tempo must be applauded, even if it hasn\u2019t yet brought the silverware the huge investment in their squad will demand sooner rather than later. Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss fires out a pass during a frantic opening quarter in Dublin . The 22-year-old Ford was at the heart of everything they did while Watson proved razor-sharp every time he received the ball. With 47 minutes gone, and Leinster winger Fergus McFadden off the field with a concussion sustained in a tackle from Kyle Eastmond, Ford produced his second moment of magic. This time he stepped on the inside of Devin Toner, before turning on the after-burners and feeding inside to his second-row captain Stuart Hooper to crash over. Suddenly, Bath believed. Another Madigan penalty \u2014 his sixth of the afternoon \u2014 made it 18-12 to Leinster but Bath had the bit between their teeth. Watson fells the full force of Ben Teo'o's tackle as Kyle Eastmond (left) moves in to support his team-mate . Bath flanker Carl Fearns eyes up Madigan in defence as Jimmy Gopperth (right) looks to make the hit . Watson made a scintillating break from deep within his half before feeding the ball to Ford who in turn flipped a pass to Horacio Agulla. Agonisingly, with the line beckoning, the winger dropped the ball and the chance was lost. It proved a critical moment in an absorbing game. Ford kicked another penalty to drag the score back to 18-15 with six minutes left but the visitors were unable to land the killer blow as Garvey was harshly penalised by Garces with seconds on the clock. Ultimately the first half had cost Ford\u2019s men a crack at Toulon or Wasps in the semi-final. \u2018It was a pretty stressful last 15 minutes,\u2019 Leinster director of rugby Matt O\u2019Connor said. \u2018I was pretty relaxed before that but they came back really strong. Watson is dangerous from broken field and he cut us up a couple of times. They had threats all over the field. I was pretty relieved by the end.\u2019 Leinster flanker Jordi Murphy rises high to claim a lineout as the Bath pack get ready to defend another attack .

The bleak study says animals are most at risk in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. While another group of researchers have added to the forecast with a separate study, which warns that marine animals near\u00a0North America, Antarctica and New Zealand are most likely to die out. Scientists warn that one in every six species of animals could face extinction if we do nothing to combat climate change and those in\u00a0South America, Australia, and New Zealand are most at risk. A stock image of an endangered flightless k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d parrot, native to New Zealand, is shown . Scientists from the University of Connecticut warned that one in six animals are at risk of extinction, particularly in regions where\u00a0shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem. Dr Mark Urban  studied data from 131 biodiversity studies to come to his bleak conclusions, which are published in the journal, Science. He proposes that the rate of extinction will speed up in line with rising temperatures. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2 per cent. Researchers from the University of Connecticut warned  animals in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem are most at risk. Antarctica, which is home to many species of penguins (stock image) is one of these places . But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16 per cent, he said. 'If the world does not come together and control greenhouse gas emissions and we allow the Earth to warm considerably we will face a potential loss of one in six species,' Dr Urban told the BBC. 'Many species will be able to shift their ranges and keep up with climate change whereas others will not either because their habitat has disappeared or because they can't reach their habitat anymore.' If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, the study warns, which could be bad news for endangered jaguars . In a separate study from the University of Berkeley in California, scientists examined extinction rates in fossils over 23 million years. They found that the tropics and Antarctica are most at risk and animals such as whales and dolphins are especially vulnerable . Another study published at the same time has compounded the warning. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and other institutions examined fossils to determine which marine life is most at risk of dying out, based on previous rates of extinction. A study by the University of Connecticut has found that global warming is accelerating the world\u2019s extinctions. One in six species could face extinction due to the effects of climate change if carbon emissions continue at current rates, it warns. Dr Mark Urban from the university came to the conclusion by correlating information from 131 biodiversity studies. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16%, he said. Animals in small geographic ranges are most at risk - with whales, dolphins and seals proving particularly vulnerable in the past, the study, which is also published in Science, says. The researchers used patterns from the fossil record to assess the natural extinction risk of animals living in the oceans today. Comparing these patterns with areas where human activities, such as fishing, impact the oceans revealed areas that may be particularly sensitive. These areas included  regions of the tropics such as the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, as well as regions such as Antarctica that harbour many unique species. \u2018The implications of these patterns for the future of coastal marine ecosystems will depend on how natural risk and current threats interact,\u2019 said co-author Dr Paul Harnik, an assistant professor of geosciences at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \u2018By understanding these patterns in the past, we hope to provide a framework for understanding global change.\u2019 The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil types over the past 23 million years. They found that worldwide patterns of extinction remained remarkably similar over the whole period, with the same groups of animals showing similar rates of extinction.

The detailed study examined 2,397 fossil genera over the past 23 million years across a variety of animal groups. The team then compared the 'natural' risk of extinction, based on historic evidence, with current threats from humans and climate change . By combining this \u2018natural\u2019 extinction risk with threats from humans and climate change, they created a global map of future hotspots of extinction. \u2018Our goal was to diagnose which species are vulnerable in the modern world, using the past as a guide,\u2019 said lead author Dr Seth Finnegan, an assistant professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. \u2018We believe the past can inform the way we plan our conservation efforts. \u2018However, there is a lot more work that needs to be done to understand the causes underlying these patterns and their policy implications.\u2019 England will experience a significant increase in the number of record-breaking warm years due to geenhouse gas emissions, scientists have claimed.

{"input": "Memories of drunken escapades may make us blush, but now a computer can use similar facial flushes to recognise people who have had one drink too many. Greek researchers created the algorithm, which determines a person\u2019s state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face - especially the forehead and nose. And they say the technology could one day be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition. Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers\u2019 faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober (left) and drunken images (right) pixel-by-pixel (a single pixel is shown above the left eyebrow) Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers\u2019 faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. Many people feel warmer and have hot flushes after drinking alcohol, caused by the drug affecting brain chemistry and the circulatory system. When alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream it increases heart rate and blood pressure and blood vessels open wide to allow for more rapid flow, which causes some people to flush. Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the spectrum and create images of the radiation, where warm areas are shown red and cooler areas, blue, for example. In the study, the researchers found that the temperature of the forehead and to a lesser extent, the nose, is the best indication of a person\u2019s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90% accuracy. While the alcohol got some volunteers more tipsy than others, they all had a blood alcohol content of at least 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. This figure is the drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries \u2013 but slightly below the English and Welsh limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober and drunken images pixel-by-pixel. They found that the temperature of the forehead, and to a lesser extent the nose, is the best indication of a person\u2019s drunken state and built an algorithm to recognise intoxication with 90 per cent accuracy. The scientists wrote in the study, published in the journal Forensic Journal International: \u2018It was found that it was mainly the face forehead that changed thermal behaviour with alcohol consumption.' The algorithm worked even on faces that it hadn\u2019t been trained on, and without comparing them to images of people when they were sober.

Alcohol also affects the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's temperature. Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. It could perhaps work in tandem with other technology to stop a car from being able to be driven. Scientists in Germany are already working on a way to stop drink drivers getting behind the wheel by analysing their speechm for example. They announced in December they have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made by researchers from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. While the alcohol got some more tipsy than others, all the volunteers in the study had a blood alcohol content of 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood, which is the\u00a0drink driving limit in Scotland as well as most European countries.

The researchers hope their technology could be used by the police to spot intoxicated people who might start trouble at football matches, for example and say it could be installed in cars and lorries to spot potential drink drivers. Currently, breathalyzers (pictured) are used to measure alcohol content . From this, an algorithm capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, was created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. They found they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk \u2013 perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver\u2019s voice. \u2018The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,\u2019 the researchers explained.", "answer": "Researchers from the University of Patras, in Greece created the algorithm .\nDetermines a person's state of\u00a0intoxication\u00a0by their facial temperature .\nAnalysing the\u00a0forehead and nose gives an\u00a0accuracy\u00a0rate of 90 per cent .\nExperts say system could one day be used by the police, and even in cars .", "completion": ["Greek researchers have developed an algorithm that uses thermal infrared photographs to determine a person's state of intoxication by looking at the temperature of their face, particularly the forehead and nose, with 90% accuracy, which could potentially be used to prevent drunk driving."]}
{"input": "The dawn of a new era of space travel may be upon us after Amazon's Jeff Bezos successfully tested a vehicle that will take tourists into space. Mr Bezos' firm, called the Blue Origin company, has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos. And now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality. Scroll down for video . Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has completed a successful spaceflight test in West Texas (shown). The New Shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles (94km) - four miles short of space - before landing. It was unmanned, but will ultimately take six people into space . The test took place from the company\u2019s launch site in West Texas. Called New Shepard, the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six-seater capsule on top, standing 60ft (18 metres) tall. The New Shepard system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys. It includes a Crew Capsule carrying six astronauts atop a separate rocket-powered Propulsion Module, launched from the firm's West Texas Launch Site. Following liftoff, the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes. The Propulsion Module then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the Crew Capsule. The Propulsion Module will finish its flight, descend to Earth, and autonomously perform a rocket-powered vertical landing. The Crew Capsule will go on to coast to the edge of space, providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the Earth and the beauty of our planet. After descent and re-entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the Crew Capsule will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site. In addition, the New Shepard vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment. For this, the first test flight of the entire architecture, it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space. The cost of a ticket has not yet been announced, but estimates suggest it will be around \u00a3130,000 $200,000 - similar to a flight on Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic. The difference, however, is that while Galactic relies on using a plane to slowly rise into the atmosphere, New Shepard takes off straight up and lands back on the ground. This is known as vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL). And Blue Origin is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise. In video released by Blue Origin, the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the New Shepard vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future. Once it reached its peak altitude, accelerating at 3Gs, the booster separated from the capsule. \u2018The in-space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect,\u2019 Mr Bezso said in a blog post. \u2018Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return.\u2019 The flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company didn't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals Virgin Galactic and SpaceX who are very open about the tests they will be performing . At peak altitude, 307,000ft (58 miles, 94km) up, the main booster separated from the capsule. On the left, the booster can be seen falling away, while on the right a distant view of the separation is seen. The booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch . Ultimately, the flights will enable six people to go to space. While in space, huge windows will give the customers a stunning view of Earth (artist's impression shown), and they'll also have several minutes of weightlessness, before the capsule falls to Earth and lands using parachutes . Here the capsule is seen returning to Earth on this test flight with its three parachutes.\u00a0\u2018Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,' Amazon's Jeff Bezos said in a blog post announcing the successful flight . The booster is designed to be able to land on the ground and be reusable, much like rival SpaceX\u2019s own reusable rocket system. On this occasion, however, the booster lost pressure in its hydraulic system and was not recovered. Mr Bezos said the firm was already working on an improved system to make sure the error doesn\u2019t happen again. \u2018Assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway - we\u2019ll be ready to fly again soon,\u2019 he said. In a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company's launch site in West Texas - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret . Jeff Bezos (pictured) is better known as the CEO and founder of Amazon, with a fortune of \u00a322.5 billion ($34.7 billion). He founded his Blue Origin company in 2000 . Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder and electric car maker, is competing against Bezos to develop a re-usable rocket . An isolated edge of vast West Texas is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st-century space race, one of two being directed in the Lone Star State by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart. The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in nearby Van Horn, a way station along Interstate 10, a full decade after he began buying land in one of Texas' largest and most remote counties. At the opposite end \u2014 of Texas and the competition \u2014 is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources \u2014 Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion \u2014 and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Earlier this year a dispute over a design of a floating landing platform - which would be used to launch and land rockets in the middle of the ocean - was dragged through the courts. But a judge said the confrontation would be allowed to continue. In part they are racing to be the first to manufacture and successfully operate reusable rockets - making space flight cheaper. According to The Washington Post,\u00a0SpaceX has been working on the technology for years, and in January attempted the unprecedented landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge it calls an autonomous spaceport droneship. However the barge and the rocket exploded. SpaceX founder and Musk, center, and Texas Governor Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas, in September 2014 . Combined, the booster and capsule stand 60ft (18 metres) tall, with a feather painted onto the side . This is the walkway astronauts will ultimately use when the company stars its manned flights . In this first test flight, the New Shepard vehicle rose to an altitude of 58 miles (94km). This is four miles (six kilometres) short of the official boundary of space - the Karman Line - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future . The flight of the capsule, however, passed without a hitch and it successfully landed on the ground with the help of three parachutes. The company is keen on VTVL because it is \u2018scalable to a very large size,\u2019 according to Mr Bezos. And he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle, New Shepard\u2019s \u2018Very Big Brother\u2019, which is apparently many times New Shepard\u2019s size with five times as much thrust. The company has not yet revealed when it\u2019s next flight will be, or when manned flights will begin. 'We won\u2019t be publishing a calendar for our test flight programme. And, nothing further to contribute regarding pricing,' a spokesperson from Blue Origin told MailOnline. But following this successful flight, many will be expecting the company to go from strength to strength.", "answer": "His Blue Origin company completed a successful test in West Texas .\nThe New Shepard vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles before landing .\nIt was unmanned but will ultimately take six people into space .\nThe launch was conducted in secrecy before being released to the public .", "completion": ["Amazon's Jeff Bezos' firm, Blue Origin, has successfully tested a vehicle, New Shepard, that aims to take tourists into space, reaching a height of 58 miles before landing; the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space, with a ticket estimated to cost around \u00a3130,000 ($200,000)."]}
{"input": "The Pillars of Creation are one of the most iconic images ever to be captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Now, astronomers have produced the first complete three-dimensional view of these beautiful columns of interstellar gas and dust. The image, together with data collected by Nasa, suggests these structures only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms. Scroll down for video . The new observations, taken by the European Space Agency, reveal many new details \u2014 including a previously unseen jet from a young star. The original  Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago and immediately became one of its most famous and evocative pictures. The jutting structures, along with the nearby star cluster, NGC 6611, are parts of a star formation region called the Eagle Nebula, also known as Messier 16 or M16. The nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). Located in the Eagle Nebula, Messier 16, researchers used\u00a0the Muse instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) create the 3D view. The new study reports fresh evidence for two gestating stars in the left and middle pillars as well as a jet from a young star that had escaped attention up to now. For more stars to form in environments like the Pillars of Creation, it is a race against time as intense radiation from the powerful stars that are already shining continues to grind away at the pillars. By measuring the Pillars of Creation's rate of evaporation, Muse has given astronomers a time frame for when the pillars will be no more. They shed about 70 times the mass of the sun every million years or so. Based on the their present mass of about 200 times that of the sun, the Pillars of Creation have an expected lifetime of perhaps three million more years. Some scientists have put forward the theory that the Pillars of Creation were already killed by a neighboring supernova some 6,000 years ago. If this is the case, astronomers on Earth won\u2019t know for another 1,000 years, when the light from the descruction reaches our planet. 'The original Nasa/Esa Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago and immediately became one of its most famous and evocative pictures,' said Esa.' This view shows how the MUSE instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope has created a three-dimensional view of the iconic Pillars of Creation in the star-forming region Messier 16. Each pixel in the data corresponds to a spectrum. The 'slices' of data correspond to some of the different chemical elements present. 'Since then, these billowing clouds, which extend over a few light-years, have awed scientists and the public alike.' The jutting structures, along with the nearby star cluster, NGC 6611, are parts of a star formation region called the Eagle Nebula, also known as Messier 16 or M16. The nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light-years away in the constellation of Serpens (The Serpent). The Pillars of Creation are a classic example of the column-like shapes that develop in the giant clouds of gas and dust that are the birthplaces of new stars. The columns arise when immense, freshly formed blue\u2013white O and B stars give off intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds that blow away less dense materials from their vicinity. Denser pockets of gas and dust, however, can resist this erosion for longer. Behind such thicker dust pockets, material is shielded from the harsh, withering glare of O and B stars. The original NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image of the famous Pillars of Creation was taken two decades ago . This shielding creates dark 'tails' or 'elephant trunks', which we see as the dusky body of a pillar, that point away from the brilliant stars. ESO's Muse instrument on the Very Large Telescope has now helped illustrate the ongoing evaporation of the Pillars of Creation in unprecedented detail, revealing their orientation. MUSE has shown that the tip of the left pillar is facing us, atop a pillar that is is actually situated behind NGC 6611, unlike the other pillars. This tip is bearing the brunt of the radiation from NGC 6611's stars, and as a result looks brighter to our eyes than the bottom left, middle and right pillars, whose tips are all pointed away from our view. Astronomers hope to better understand how young O and B stars like those in NGC 6611 influence the formation of subsequent stars.

The grandmother told a friend she was 'utterly heartbroken' at the news about Chan, who she had befriended in Bali's squalid Kerobokan prison. The Australian pair were\u00a0the first to die in the latest round of executions  after a final KFC bucket meal. She said: 'The men shot dead were reformed men \u2013 good men who transformed the lives of people around them.

Sandiford says Chan \u2013 who was sentenced to death in 2005 for masterminding the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot \u2013 helped her cope in jail after she was given her death penalty two years ago. She said: 'I really admire Andrew. He's been an incredible help to me and he would be there for anyone who genuinely needed help inside the prison. 'The heart of the prison has gone since they left. They organised rehabilitation projects. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have running water on the blocks, or the classes in painting, cookery and computers. I would like to send my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones. 'Many things have been said about whether Andrew and Myuran deserved to die for their crimes. I didn\u2019t know those men at the time they committed those crimes 10 years ago. What I can say is that the Andrew and Myuran I knew were men who did good and touched the lives of a great many people, including myself.' Chan \u2013 who turned to Christianity and was ordained in prison earlier this year \u2013 told Sandiford shortly before his transfer to Execution Island that he was reconciled to his fate. He said: 'I'm not afraid to die but I am afraid of dying. I'm scared of the bullets and I'm scared it won't be a quick death.' The Australian pair were killed by a firing squad on Bali's 'death island',\u00a0Nusa Kambangan . Sandiford has been languishing on death row in Bali since being convicted of attempting to smuggle \u00a31.6million of cocaine through the island's airport in 2012.

Earlier ambulances carrying the corpses of Chan and Sukumaran arrived from the 'death island' where they were shot dead. The families of Chan and Sukumaran released a statement following the executions. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers,' they said. 'In the ten years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others. They asked for mercy, but there was none. 'They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.'

{"input": "Carl Frampton has been offered a huge \u00a31.5million payday to face Scott Quigg in one of the biggest all-British fights in recent memory. Talks between the two super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill, but Quigg\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, attempted to jolt Frampton\u2019s camp into a July 18 fight in Manchester by offering the biggest cheque of the Northern Irishman\u2019s career to date. The proposal was made live on television, with Frampton\u2019s team, led by Barry McGuigan\u2019s Cyclone Promotions, given until the end of the week to accept the terms.

But with the fight more than a year in the making a low revenues seems unlikely, although at present there is only a moderate chance Frampton\u2019s camp will accept the terms, having released their own statement to demand further talks. Quigg said: \u2018He called me out on national TV and I saw on Twitter that he apparently said I\u2019m a Sky hype job. Well come and fight the hype job. \u2018I respect him as a fighter, he is very good. And I believe he does want the fight and he genuinely believes he will beat me. If he wants the fight then tell his team, the offer is there. I generally believe he wants the fight but we will find out if he actually does \u2013 there is \u00a31.5m if he wants it. \u2018He has one and a half million reasons to fight me.\u2019 Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . Hearn added: \u2018Scott might not get \u00a31.5m. That is not how this offer is working. This offer is us working together to come up with an offer, that we believe Carl Frampton cannot turn down. If it doesn\u2019t do the pay-per-view buys that we anticipate, Scott might get a third of that (\u00a3500,000 to Frampton\u2019s \u00a31.5m). We take the risk. Carl does not have to take any risk.\u2019 Hearn and McGuigan met in London a fortnight ago to discuss the bout, as reported by Sportsmail. Those talks ended in stalemate, with Cyclone Promotions insisting on Tuesday that Hearn would have to return to the negotiating table if the fight is to happen. The statement read: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting. \u2018If Matchroom Sport does not want to meet, Carl Frampton will make an optional defence of his IBF world title this summer.\u2019 Carl Frampton lands a punch on American opponent Chris Avalos during their fight last month .

{"input": "'You guys ready to play some golf?' asked the starter. And, yes he was. That's exactly what Tiger Woods was ready for. Some golf. He smiled, slapped his playing partner Rory McIlroy on the back. Damn right he was ready. Not to win maybe. Not yet. By the summer, though, who knows? There have been enough sightings of the old Tiger at Augusta this week not to give up on him yet. The problem with new Tiger, though, is that as desperate as he appears to march on, obstacles line his path, like tree roots. In some cases, exactly like tree roots. At the ninth, playing out of the Augusta pines, Woods found such a root at full pelt on his follow through. He dropped his club like a red-hot poker, face creased with pain. Woods claimed that a bone popped out in his right arm, right there, but he reset it. There was a degree of scepticism about the extent of that injury, but either way it continued to bother him for several holes and was rotten luck. There is, however, a well-worn method of avoiding such misfortune. Hit it on the fairway. Woods did not find a solitary preferred landing area until the 13th, when he was rewarded with an eagle. Up to that point, he spent so much time in the trees he should have been fitted with a lumberjack shirt. At the tenth he was in so deep they were thinking of sending Lassie for help. Tiger Woods looks over his second shot on the seventh hole as the Augusta crowd look on . Woods (left) speaks to playing partner Rory McIlroy as the pair wait to tee off on the first tee . Woods reacts in pain after hitting a shot out of the pine straw on the ninth hole . Still, it could have been worse. This was the Masters that Tiger was advised to miss. There were some sage voices out there, saying his old friend would turn on him, that he might be embarrassed by his favourite homeland course. His game was broken, he was broken, it was argued. This was no country for an old man with faltering short irons. Some folk wanted their happy memories preserved. These four days, however, have revealed a healthier reality. Woods didn't come back too soon, he just took his leave too late. Looking at the tournaments he played in January and February, it was plain he didn't want to be there. He should have called time out then. Had he done so, had he started his recovery earlier, who knows where his game would have been by the time he reached Augusta? Were it not for the phenomenon of Jordan Spieth's first 54 holes, he would have been in contention here starting the final day. Woods, like McIlroy, began six under par but with Spieth ten shots ahead, it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge. Woods would have needed a score approaching the course record, and Spieth a collapse \u2013 and he is not well-placed for miracles yet. Another major? Well, you wouldn't bet against that one. Woods tees off on the tenth but in the end he did not manage to challenge runaway winner Jordan Spieth . Woods plays out of the bunker by the sixteenth green at Augusta National . It could be argued that the enthusiasm for Tiger's performance this weekend shows how far he has fallen. After all, two of his four rounds \u2013 the first and last \u2013 were over par, and in the head to head on Sunday McIlroy beat him by seven shots. This was far from tournament winning golf. Then again McIlroy is the world No 1, Woods 110 places below and has barely played this year. He has reshaped his swing which continues to be a work in progress. He would not say when he will play next after this. 'It won't be for a while,' Woods confirmed. 'I like what I'm doing, so I'm going to go back and work on that.' Where this will leave him for the Majors short-term it is hard to say. He finished in the top 20 here, his best return since 2013 and many rated this as the best of several recent comebacks, one that inspired speculation about his readiness for St Andrews in July. He loves the Old Course almost as much as he loves Augusta. It brings the best out of him \u2013 and Tiger's best may still be good enough, somewhere, some day. He was blown away here \u2013 they all were \u2013 by a 21-year-old Texan who has rewritten the record books. By the time Woods and McIlroy stood on the tee at 2.30pm local time, Spieth had spoiled it for just about everyone. Only two men \u2013 Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson \u2013 were deemed capable of catching him. The world finally saw the two biggest names in golf paired in the final round of a major, only for it to be part of a distant undercard. Maybe that was why Sunday's round fell flat \u2013 for Woods, not McIlroy. McIlroy (left) celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the eighteenth green as Woods looks on . McIlroy (right) taps Woods on the shoulder after the pair shake hands following the end of their round . The Ulsterman finished fourth and shot 66 to equal the best round of the day. Once again, inconsistency cost him dear at Augusta. He was three over par through the first 27 and with Spieth scoring so fiercely the Masters was gone from there. It is Woods's record of 18 under par that Spieth has equalled. In the difficult circumstances that preceded this tournament, Tiger most certainly brought his A game, circa 2015; how was he to know he also required a time machine to make it 1997 again and stay in the mix? What is plain, despite Sunday's disappointment, is that rumours of Tiger's demise were exaggerated. He was diagnosed from afar as having the chipping yips, and there were plenty of amateur physicians declaring his condition at best chronic and at worst incurable. Phil Mickelson, however, offered a second opinion. Speaking at Torrey Pines, where Woods quit after 12 holes to rebuild his short game, he was a rare voice predicting this cautiously positive return. 'I think Tiger's going to have the last laugh,' Mickelson said. 'I think his short game, historically, is one of the best of all time and when you haven't played it's the first thing to feel uncomfortable and the quickest thing to get back. I don't think he's going to have any problems. We have all had stretches where we don't hit it solid and usually it's just a small tweak. It's such a short swing that it's not a hard thing to fix. I don't see that lasting more than a week or two.' Last year's champion Bubba Watson (left) presents winner Spieth with the green jacket at Augusta . Woods reacts after missing a birdie putt on the twelfth hole on Sunday afternoon . Woods hits from the edge of the pine by the tenth hole as the large crowds behind him watch on . It took a little longer than that \u2013 with considerably harder graft \u2013 but considering some feared we had seen the last of Tiger, this was a tentative return to form. If there was a turning point, it came at the 11th on day one, when he missed the green right and saved par with a quite fabulous chip. Anyone who had the chipping yips, it was said, would still be there now, trying to get up and down. Woods would have known the world was watching his every tic, too. His golf has not been without flaws since, not least his driving, but his short game was a weapon around Augusta, as it once was. There had been a practice round earlier in the week in which Woods was rumoured to have outplayed Spieth down the back nine. There was no sign of that individual superiority over the ensuing four days \u2013 19 shots between them and Spieth leading wire to wire \u2013 but this was never about Woods winning at Augusta. This was about him being back in the game, holding his end up, about him looking like he was enjoying golf, and life, and there was certainly evidence of that. He will probably need to work sun up to sun down again, and to win a minor, before he can land a major, but would anyone bet against it given the sight of him walking Augusta on Sunday in the company of the world No 1?

Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness. The description for the unsettling video claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay after local workers found the animal swimming . The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in\u00a0Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated .

Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot .

But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well.

{"input": "REJECTION PROOF . by Jia Jiang . (Random House, \u00a313.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it\u2019s galling. And in every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn\u2019t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn\u2019t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of \u2018quest\u2019 books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn\u2019t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch\u2019s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying \u2018Free refill\u2019, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. \u2018When are you looking for these?\u2019 she asked. \u2018In the next . . . 15 minutes?\u2019 \u2018Let me see what I can do,\u2019 she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it\u2019s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang\u2019s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else\u2019s opinion, and it may not be the right one.", "answer": "It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected .\nAnd in each and every case there\u2019s nothing we can do about it .\nJia Jiang, with his exceptional optimism, proposes an alternative thesis .\nHe has developed an entertaining study of rejection in all its many forms .", "completion": ["\"Rejection Proof\" by Jia Jiang is a study of rejection where the author deliberately seeks out situations in which he is likely to be rejected for 100 days, documenting his experiences on his blog, with the message that rejection is only someone else's opinion and how we respond to it is what truly matters."]}

Sarah Weatherill, 31, became so dependent on the energy drink she was told if she cut down too quickly she could suffer a seizure as her body was so used to the caffeine. The law student spent a staggering \u00a35,460 every year on the popular energy drink  since she became hooked in 2009. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weatherill, 31, was so addicted to Red Bull she drank 24 cans a day leaving her lethargic, depressed, suffering heart palpitations and constantly anxious . Her habit was at its worst the following year when she was studying for a law degree and wanted to stay awake to revise for exams. She soon became dependent on the drink and couldn't get out of bed unless she knew she had some in the fridge. She also became lethargic, depressed, had heart palpitations and was constantly feeling anxious as her \u00a3105-a-week habit spiralled out of control. She finally decided to do something about the problem after she realised the constant need for the Red Bull was severely damaging her health. And after seeing hypnotherapist earlier this month, she claims she has been cured of her addiction thanks to just one 50-minute session. Her habit had been so dangerous she needed to cut down to eight cans a day in the run up to the hypnosis - as coming off so much caffeine abruptly could have caused a seizure. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains: . 80mg of caffeine - the same amount as in an espresso. 27.5g sucrose and glucose combined - the equivalent of almost seven teaspoons of sugar. 10g Taurine (an amino acid that is thought to boost athletic performance). B vitamins. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half the potentially lethal dose. Ms Weatherill, from Coventry, said: 'I was studying for a Higher National Certificate in law in 2005 and used to have the odd Red Bull for a pick me up. 'It is hard to say when it became every day but I remember that by 2009 I was definitely hooked. 'Whenever I felt tired having a Red Bull would be the first thing I would do. 'It was  worst in 2010 when I was doing law exams at university and my children were off school. 'Sometimes I would have exams day after day - and with the stress of revising I was having 24 cans a day. 'I was pulling all-nighters and using the drinks to stay awake. In the end, it got to the point where I just needed Red Bull to function. 'I used to get my shopping delivered and used to have four or five crates and that only lasted for a week - it got out of hand. 'There would be times when I would get palpitations and shakes but I think I just got used to the caffeine.' Red Bull - whose slogan says the drink 'gives you wings' - is made by an Austrian company and is the highest selling energy drink in the world. Miss Weatherill claims she was cured of her addiction in one 50 minutes hypnotherapy session with\u00a0David Kilmurry (pictured right) This table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances. Ms Weatherill was drinking 1.92g of caffeine every day, way above the recommended limit of 400 mg . The drink has been branded safe by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and more than five billion cans were sold in 2013. However, it has been criticised for its high caffeine levels with one 250ml can containing 80mg, similar to one cup of coffee. Ms Weatherill's 24-a-day habit meant she was drinking 1.92g of the drug every day. A 2005 study into caffeine-related deaths said a person would need to ingest 5g to overdose, suggesting she was taking nearly half of a lethal dose. But, incredibly, she claims she was completely cured of her addiction after a single session with cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist David Kilmurry on April 11. Ms Weatherill, who lives with boyfriend Phil Evans, 27, and four children aged between three and 14, added: 'I knew at the start of this year it was a dependency so thought I would give hypnotherapy a go. 'It was a weird process, I felt like I was in there for 15 minutes but it was 50 minutes. 'All I can remember is that it was like a kaleidoscope effect, I remember him saying I didn't need Red Bull.' 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person,' Ms Weatherill said after undergoing hypnotherapy to cure her of her energy drink habit . She added: 'It was like a paralysis because I had an itch, but couldn't move to scratch it. 'It gave me a lot of strength because in the past I have tried to give up but lasted a week and then gone back to the Red Bull. 'I am convinced I won't have another can. I feel like a different person.' Hypnotherapist Mr Kilmurry added: 'Sarah's addiction was very serious. 'Coming off that amount of caffeine and taurine  can lead to seizures, so she gradually reduced her intake before coming to me to make a safe escape. 'Energy drink addicts can also suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety and heart palpitations.

{"input": "Former Treasurer Peter Costello has fired a damaging salvo at the Abbott government just weeks out from its second budget, describing its approach to taxation as a 'morbid joke'. Ever since the government released his tax discussion paper calling for a 'lower, simpler, fairer' system there has been nothing but suggestions for taxes that are higher, more complicated and less economic, the former Liberal treasurer in an opinion piece in the Daily Telegraph.

{"input": "A holidaymaker still has sickness issues, nine months after he first contracted food poisoning on holiday in Egypt. James Houlder and his girlfriend, Vicki Hood, had saved up for months for the sunshine break at the Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh. But within just hours of arriving at the First Choice resort, which is described as five-star on its website, the couple say they became violently ill with sickness and diarrhoea and were barely able to leave their room. James Houlder fell ill while on holiday with his partner Vicki Hood last summer at the Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, and is still suffering nine months on . James, 30, who works for a publishing company, has since developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a digestive complaint which he admits can leave him in crippling pain with him sometimes needing the toilet several times an hour. Vicki, 22, claims she too has been plagued by sickness including a kidney infection. The couple, who live just outside Norwich, had booked the break last summer and envisaged 10 days sunning themselves on the beach and scuba diving in the famous Red Sea. But instead James said: 'On the first night we got there in time for the end of dinner and that's where it all started to go wrong. The next morning, after breakfast, we started to become violently ill. We had to take it in turns to use the bathroom. 'When we finally felt better a few days later we decided to eat at one of the resort's a la carte restaurants. We thought it would be safer than the buffet but it just made us ill all over again. Mr Houlder took a photo of a piece of mouldy bread while he was on holiday in Sharm El Sheikh . 'We were both so ill we were crying. It was dreadful, the worst holiday ever. 'The rooms were dated and dirty and the staff were rude. 'It was like a holiday coming home.' James claims they asked to get earlier return flights but were told it would cost them hundreds of pounds. After investing around \u00a31,500 already in the all-inclusive deal, he says they were forced to sit it out in the blistering heat. And once at home James told how the health problems continued with IBS still causing him to take time off or away from work nine months on. He said: 'It's sporadic, it's not something that happens all the time, but equally it can come on without warning. One minute I'm fine and the next I can be in agony. 'The other day I had to stop twice on the way to work to go to the toilet and it's only a 20-minute drive. 'I've been in situations where I've been going many times an hour and trying to hide it. It's awful and embarrassing.' James says he was offered a \u00a350 'goodwill voucher' but no apology from First Choice and has now instructed law firm Slater and Gordon to launch a civil case against the travel company, part of the TUI Group. A spokesperson for First Choice told MailOnline Travel: 'First Choice is sorry to hear of the couple\u2019s experience during their holiday in Egypt. 'Our ultimate priority is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers and we operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.' The Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh will provide bad memories for James Houlder . Richard Duxbury, a specialist travel lawyer from Slater and Gordon, representing Mr Houlder, said: 'Mr Houlder and his partner paid a substantial amount of money to go on what they thought would be a relaxing getaway. 'Instead the holiday was ruined by entirely unacceptable hygiene standards which have left both of them still suffering the effects several months after returning home.' MailOnline Travel has also contacted Sonesta Beach Resort, and is awaiting a response. James Houlder says numerous meals at the Sonesta Beach Resort made him and his partner sick . Alex Comley fell ill during a family holiday to the Sonesta Beach Resort in Egypt . EasyJet pilot Alex Comley, 33, from Bracknell, Berks, booked a 10-day break to Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt last July with tour operator Thomson Holidays with his wife Louise, 36, and two-year-old son Sebastian. However, the all-inclusive trip, which cost nearly \u00a32,000, was ruined only four days after they arrived when Alex was struck down by Salmonella at their four-star resort. He claims his illness became so serious that after returning home he needed medical treatment and was unable to return to work for EasyJet for more than a month. He said: 'We were all very excited about the trip abroad as it was the first family holiday since my son Sebastian was born. 'We had planned on doing so many 'firsts' and really wanted Sebastian to have a wonderful time on his holiday and enjoy spending some real quality time together as a family. However the holiday turned into a nightmare.' On the fourth day he woke up with crippling stomach pains and was in agony for the rest of the holiday, suffering with vomiting and diarrhoea. 'I have never been so unwell. I couldn't be away from the toilet for any extended periods as I was so ill so I was basically trapped in a hotel room for nearly the entire time. 'I had only eaten in the hotel as it was an all-inclusive holiday, so I must have eaten something there to cause the problems.' An appointment with the doctor on his return home apparently confirmed that he had contracted a serious strain of salmonella food poisoning and couldn't return to his job for more than four weeks. Alex, who says he hasn't received an apology from the firm, has instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch a legal case against Thomson Holidays. The case is ongoing. In a statement, Thomson Holidays said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr Comley's experience during his trip to Egypt.

{"input": "What Alastair Cook did here, particularly in the first hour of his innings, was spot-on. That has to be his template from now on and if he carries on the way he has played here in Grenada, those hundreds will come again. This was really encouraging for the England captain but ultimately hugely frustrating because he couldn\u2019t push on to that all-important hundred. Cook\u2019s problem has been opponents stopping him scoring in areas where he has always been prolific. He has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before. Alastair Cook's innings into day three in Grenada was spot on, particularly the first hour of it . Cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing Shannon Gabriel on for 76 . Yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 Test hundreds cannot drive the ball. Of course he can. The key for him is not to play the drive too early, when the ball is moving around and his balance at the crease is not quite right. Perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket, perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again, but Cook has been searching for the ball far too early. Here he left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, which took a lot of mental strength and composure. The drag-on was always going to be a danger on this pitch but Cook was right to try to play that shot because the cut is one of his big strengths. His eyes lit up when he was bowled a short, wide one by Shannon Gabriel. But the ball just lacked pace, Cook was through the shot too early, the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play. He cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery. Boy, do I admire Cook\u2019s fortitude and the concentration he showed on that sluggish pitch with an incredibly slow outfield. The England captain hits behind square on the onside as Jermaine Blackwood ducks for cover . Cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, but drove when the option arose . He is stronger mentally than anyone he will face, so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline. The bowlers will become bored before he does. The fact is, 76 here was pretty much worth a hundred in these day-three conditions, but sadly for Cook that is not how the record books will show it. The England captain was aided by the fact the ball did not swing much for West Indies, because it is the moving delivery that has caused him so many problems. It is to Cook\u2019s credit that he has not looked under pressure in this second Test and his recent statistics \u2014 four scores of 70-plus in his last seven Test innings \u2014 are absolutely fine for a normal human being. The problem for him is that until the age of 28 he wasn\u2019t normal; he was an absolute run machine. Cook's off stump is rattled after a wide delivery from Gabriel found the inside edge . The skipper shows his frustration as his impressive innings to this point is cut short . Gabriel celebrates after Cook's eyes lit but the ball just lacked pace and he was through the shot too early . West Indies celebrate the breakthrough  but Cook cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery . Cook just has to put that one key statistic to bed and finally reach three figures, then move on with such a big summer ahead. His inability to do so means we are still talking about how long it\u2019s been since his last Test century but there were good signs here. Meanwhile, Jonathan Trott still looked a little frenetic at the start of his innings, certainly for those first 10 to 15 runs when he was searching for the ball and driving when he did not need to. Jonathan Trott drives during his first innings of 59, which started day three somewhat frenetically . Cook congratulates a smiling Trott after his fellow opener reached his 50 milestone in the morning session . Yet as his innings progressed, he looked calmer and it was significant when he started walking off towards square leg between deliveries. He was in his little bubble again and it showed me that he was back. Trott has obviously been through a heck of a lot, has looked anxious and wants to prove the point that he belongs back with England and that he can open the batting in Tests. The more he played, the more he looked like Jonathan Trott. Trott looked calmer as his innings went on but Devendra Bishoo found his edge before he could go on with it . Trott leaves the field at St George's - on St George's Day - after an opening partnership of 125 runs .", "answer": "Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott put on an opening partnership of 125 .\nCook scored an encouraging 76 before playing a wide ball onto his stumps .\nThe England captain made the bowlers come to him and looked solid .\nTrott was first out  for 59 but appeared increasingly comfortable .", "completion": ["Alastair Cook's performance in the first hour of his innings in Grenada was commendable, but he was unable to reach a hundred, while Jonathan Trott started off frenetically but calmed as his innings progressed."]}
{"input": "Iran's Revolutionary Guards 'harassed' a US-flagged commercial ship just days before it seized a vessel carrying cargo and 34 sailors, it has emerged. The two incidents have raised concerns about\u00a0the security of shipping lanes in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. News of the first incident was revealed by the Pentagon after Iranian guards seized MV Maersk Tigris this week, by firing warning shots across the vessel's bows. ranian patrol vessels fired warning shots across the bridge of the Marshall\u00a0Islands-flagged cargo vessel the Maersk Tigris Tuesday morning and seized it for trespassing just days after it had 'harassed' another ship . In the April 24 incident, four Iranian patrol boats with the country's elite Revolutionary Guards 'harassed a US-flagged merchant ship called the Maersk Kensington' as it moved along an established shipping route, said Mr Warren. The Iranian vessels 'followed her for approximately 15 to 20 minutes in actions the ship master of the Kensington interpreted as aggressive,' he said. The American military was not involved in the incident and the Kensington's captain later filed a report with the US Navy describing the event. Just four days later, Iranian boats forced a Marshall Islands-flagged ship, the Maersk Tigris, to Iran's Larak Island after firing warning shots across the bows and boarding the vessel. Iran has said it seized control of the container ship due to a commercial dispute with Denmark's giant Maersk group, which chartered the vessel to ferry cargo in the region. When it was intercepted, the Tigris was traveling on an international shipping route within Iran's territorial waters. 'It's difficult to know exactly why the Iranians are behaving this way,' Warren said. 'We call on them to respect all of the internationally established rules of freedom of navigation, the law of the sea to which they are a signatory and other established protocols,' he said. The 52,600-ton container ship was built in 2014 and is managed by Singapore-based Rickmers Ship Management . Iranian sources have seized the cargo ship and claim they had a legal order following a dispute . In a statement, the Iranian Port and Maritime Organisation said the Maersk Tigris was intercepted 'upon a legal order' and transferred to Shahid Bahonar port in southern Iran. Officials claimed the order was issued following a 'long running commercial dispute' with Maersk. The ruling was 'based on a lawsuit by a private company called Pars Talayieh Oil Product company (Golden Pars Oil Products) against Maersk ship company,' it said. They said the ship can only be released following a judicial ruling. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking at New York University, said a lawsuit was filed against the ship's owners between 15 and 16 years ago over an undelivered cargo. 'It has gone through court proceedings in Tehran based on what I hear from the lawyer. The final decision by the court is that the ship's owners are supposed to pay damages,' he said. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television station reported earlier the vessel was US-flagged, but it has since emerged that the cargo ship is registered in the Pacific island nation and had no Americans aboard. The semi-official Iranian news agency Fars also reported that Iran took control of the MV Maersk Tigris for 'trespassing' on its territorial waters. Warren said the cargo ship's master had initially refused an Iranian order to move further into Iranian waters, but after the warning shots were fired the cargo ship complied. The vessel was then boarded by Iranians, but no one has been injured and no Americans are involved. Detained:\u00a0A map of the vessel's route shows that it abruptly changed course in the Strait of Hormuz this morning and was heading to the Iranian port on Bandfar Abbas . Warren said the cargo ship issued a distress call and US Naval Forces Central Command, based in the area, sent a US destroyer, the USS Farragut, and a P-3 surveillance aircraft to the area of the incident to monitor the situation. 'What they are doing is keeping an eye on things. They are in close enough proximity to the Maersk Tigris that they will be able to respond if a response is required,' he added. As the US government had defense and other ties with the Marshall Islands, US officials were 'in discussion with the Marshall Islands on the way ahead,' he said. 'The Republic of Marshall Islands has requested assistance for the release of the Maersk ship, and again, we're in communication with them about how best to expect that outcome,' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. But US officials said privately that no military action was imminent. According to the ship-tracking site MarineTraffic.com, the 52,600-ton cargo vessel, which was built last year, departed from Ambarli, Turkey April 8 en route to Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. Peacekeeper: A US destroyer, the USS Farragut (pictured), and an aircraft to the area of the incident to monitor the situation .

New of the seizure and action against another vessel comes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf, fuelled by the Yemen conflict and high-stakes diplomacy between Washington and Tehran over Iran's nuclear program. In October 2012, Maersk announced a halt to its activities in Iran after Western oil and financial sanctions were slapped on the country over its controversial nuclear program. The ship was operated by Rickmers Ship Management, with head offices in Singapore and Hamburg, and was carrying cargo for Maersk Line, the group's shipping unit which had chartered the vessel.

It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes.

Revenge: Former Ole Miss star Marshall Henderson jumped on the revelations Jarret Stoll (right) was arrested in a drugs bust last week by tweeting to Erin Andrews: 'lol wassup with your boyfriend.' He was suspended in 2013 for allegedly failing a drugs test. Andrews responded to the news then by saying: 'He mocking anyone now?' She was referencing his reputation of being a hothead and badmouthing other players. Henderson responded with the message: 'ima save that and you will be the first person ill mock.' He has waited two years to get his revenge. On Monday TMZ sports reported that the athlete was trying to smuggle over three grams of cocaine and over eight grams of MDMA by hiding them in his board shorts. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. His reaction came two years after the TV reporter said: 'He mocking anyone now?' after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. He warned the ex-Dancing With The Stars contestant she was in the firing line . After learning of Stoll's arrest, he posted this on Twitter to Andrews - getting his revenge two years on . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service. Henderson is currently playing in Baghdad in the Iraqi Super League. His history with cocaine and marijuana use led to him being undrafted by the NBA in 2014.

{"input": "Lance Armstrong has said the World Anti-Doping Agency and others are 'owed an apology' from him for cheating during his cycling career - but noted that the agency's chief rebuffed efforts to meet back in 2013. David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.'

{"input": "For a player known for his fearsome, fire-breathing nature in the centre of Arsenal\u2019s midfield, who would protect goal like it was a pot of gold, it is fitting that he is preparing to be a football manager at Dragon Park. Patrick Vieira is set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer leaving Manchester City\u2019s Head of the Elite Development equipped for the top job. He has been taking his coaching badges with the Welsh Football Association under their technical director Osian Roberts. Given Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s capitulation at City, the timing of their conclusion could not be better with Vieira itching for a chance to test himself amongst the best. Patrick Vieira has been part of the coaching team at Manchester City since he retired . Vieira worked as\u00a0Football Development Executive at City before becoming reserve team manager . Vieira is one of the potential candidates in the frame to replace Manuel Pellegrini - if he were to leave . Under Premier League rules, there is nothing stopping Vieira taking charge now as they allow coaches without the full qualifications to take charge for 12 weeks. There is currently no real hurry, but in the coming months City\u2019s top echelons will have some important decisions to make. Vieira\u2019s contract at City is due to expire this summer and he is not prepared to hang around forever waiting for a chance at the helm. City\u2019s teenagers are in awe of the man, having grown up watching him torment the Premier League for a decade at Arsenal and City and across Europe. Vieira played for Manchester City towards the end of his career after spells at Juventus and Inter Milan . Vieira was signed by former manager Roberto Mancini in 2011 . One of their brightest prospects on loan at Lille, Rony Lopes, told Sportsmail in an interview: \u2019It was like a dream just to meet someone like Vieira. For him to be the coach, it was the best thing in the world. From the first day, he was always very friendly, talking to me a lot, trying to pass on his knowledge and make me grow up as a player and a person. That was he wanted. He is very important to me. He keeps in touch with me, asking how I am.\u2019 After a poor start to his time in charge of City\u2019s young players they have made it to the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals for two successive seasons, enhancing Vieira\u2019s reputation. Young Portuguese player Rony Lopes spoke highly of\u00a0Vieira . The Frenchman also has allies in the first team, having played with Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart in his one season at the club in 2010/11. When Vieira joined City in a coaching capacity in June 2013 his aim was to see how he progressed in \u2018the next few years,\u2019 suggesting he is coming to a decision-making juncture in his career. He chose the Welsh FA and Roberts, who works alongside his deputy Carl Darlington, to complete his badges because the pair are known for developing individual coaches through their personality. Vieira is best remembered for the nine years he spent at Arsenal . Vieira made his name in England at Arsenal where he won seven major honours . Vieira has his own idea of how he wants to manage a side. \u2018My coaching style is a combination from my experience of working with Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho,\u2019 he told Sportsmail in an interview. \u2018There is a little bit of all of them, plus my own experience to deliver my message. The relationship with the players is so important. I want to trust them but they must trust me, too. I like it because I want to be close with them. \u2018 . In February he added another stellar manager to his list of influences when he spent time at Bayern Munich with Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. City\u2019s academy director Mark Allen described how he likes his sides to play: \u2018We play out from the back, through the thirds, into midfield and then a possession-based game but with fast, attacking play. We want to keep the ball, have full-backs bombing on and work on a very fast recovery.

Researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear, your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device. Called Bodyprint, the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device (shown) Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya, and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs. Details of its algorithm are included in their\u00a0paper, Bodyprint: Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices Using the Capacitive Touchscreen to Scan Body Parts. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet (three metres). Salt connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Illinois-based duo Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. 'Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users,' explained the researchers. 'However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor.' They continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch (dpi) - meaning it can't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader. This allows the touch sensor 'to scan users\u2019 body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display.' To accept an incoming call, users would only need to press their ear against the phone. During tests with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy. This accuracy was highest when scanning the ear due to its more unique shape and size. It\u2019s not just ears that could be used for identification \u2013 your first, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or just your fingertips could also be used (shown). This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you . A video demonstrating the technology revealed Bioprint can also be used to add multiple users to a single device. So, for example, if something required dual identification then both people could provide it. It\u2019s not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist, phalanges (in your fingers), palm or your fingertips could also be used. This means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you. There's no news yet on when the feature might be made available to manufacturers, but the team says their next step is to continue testing.

A \u2018Autonomous Multi-Robot System for Vehicle Extraction and Transportation\u2019 (Avert)  computer first selects a vehicle to be moved after cameras have mapping the area in detail. The Avert system then works by sending a deployment unit to scan the area again and identify new potential obstacles.

At the chip giant's developers forum in China, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich revealed the demonstration to show off the firm's button sized computed and controller wristband. He was able to cause lights on the robots to change shape, and control their movement from the bans. The robots were powered by Curie, a computer the size of a button developed by Intel. 'The Intel Curie module is a tiny hardware product based on the Intel Quark SE system chip, which is the company's first purpose-built system on a chip for wearable devices,' the firm said.

With 129,000 Instagram followers and the Hippie Lane app consistently sitting in the top three of 'most popular food and drink' apps on iTunes since its release in January, Gabrielian attributes all her  success to the re-imagining of sweet tooth favourites. 'It was definitely my tactic. I thought the best way to grow the business and inspire a healthy lifestyle was to offer people something they understand, that looks and tastes like the real deal,' the mother of two told Daily Mail Australia. Gabrielian, who began stocking raw treats in local cafes and photographing them, only realised the serious demand for her sweet treats when she reached 80,000 followers within a year. Healthy hippy: Taline Gabrielian said her choc bars satisfy her, even though she grew up on Nutella and Milo . Twix treats:\u00a0'I always crave something after dinner, so these Twix bars still give me the same satisfaction' 'They just loved  that I was portraying healthy versions of the chocolates they knew and loved. They were commenting saying \"does it really taste like a Mars Bar?,\" and basically just wanted a piece of the pie,' she said. While her app has 50 recipes in total, the classic top five favourite bars are by far her most popular, according to Gabriel. But she says her mint slice, caramel and choc cheesecake are also go down a treat too. While the chocolates are all classified as raw, vegan, refined sugar-free and dairy-free, Gabriel assured DMA that this in no way means 'fun or taste-free', people are sold by her recipes. Cherry on top: Gabriel recreated the classic cherry ripe bar for those who like a fruity take on chocolate . 'I began competitions early on (on her Instagram) to remake my treats and convince them it's the real deal and the recipes work. And they loved them, saying 'this is the best peppermint slice I've ever tried and knocking on my door wanting more.' Gabriel shares her top substitutes to eat healthy sweet treats... 1. Swap sugar for... rice malt syrup . 'It's derived from brown rice and is milled down until it becomes syrup.' 2. Swap caramel for... nut butters . 'I will mix almond butter with tahini, coconut oil and dates.' 3. Swap flour for... nut meal . 'When making a biscuit base I like to use a mix of walnuts and almond meal' 4.\u00a0Swap chocolate for... cacao powder . 'I make chocolate by mixing cacao powder, coconut oil and maple syrup.' 5.

Convenient: The Salt card (pictured) is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet, by automatically unlocking it whenever the user is nearby . Salt connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. The duo, based in Chicago, Illinois, came up with the idea as an increased method of security and a time-saving device and recently raised more than $82,000 (\u00a353,512) on Kickstarter to put it into production. The Salt card is made of durable plastic with a matte finish and is the same height and length as an ordinary credit card. However, it's three times as thick because it has to be big enough to store the battery, which lasts for 18 months. The credit card-sized gadget (illustrated) also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range.\u00a0It connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where it is suggested the Salt card is stored . The start-up claims that its Salt card is more secure than fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's iPhone 6 handset (pictured) and it can be used with gloves in the winter . Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user\u2019s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. Setting up the card is said to be simple, as users only have to enter the unique 12-digit code printed on the front of the card in the iOS or Android app to register it as their own. From then on, their phone automatically unlocks when they move within 10ft (three metres) of it. It does this thanks to a Bluetooth chip that emits a low-frequency signal that can be read by the phone, but doesn't consume the battery, according to the start-up. \u2018You don't have to connect it your phone like you normally do with Bluetooth - it basically acts as a beacon and finds your phone, unlocking it,\u2019 Mr Paglione said. The card sends notifications to a user\u2019s phone if they leave their wallet containing the card behind, as well as telling them the last location they had it. In the future it will be possible to change the proximity needed for the card to unlock the phone. \u2018So you could set it for 30 feet (9 metres) when you're in your house so you don't have to put in your pin at home, but when you're out you might want it so it only unlocks when the card is in your hand, so you could set it to one foot proximity,\u2019 he explained. It is claimed that the card  will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the time it takes to type a password into their phone 150 times a day . The card costs $20 (\u00a313) and can be ordered from the company\u2019s website. Mr Paglione, 30, said that as well as being tedious, constantly entering a password can be a security issue because criminals can spot a pattern and there are cameras everywhere. \u2018Many people are looking for additional ways to secure their phone and people are always looking for ways to save time,\u2019 he said. However, it may appear that if a user's handbag is stolen with their wallet including the card and their phone inside, Salt may prove less secure than a stanard password. MailOnline has asked the firm is this is the case. Mr Zistakis, an architect by profession, developed a prototype using a Bluetooth headset and then Mr Paglione added his manufacturing expertise to create the product. He conceded: \u2018There are other people doing similar things, but the difference is we have put it into a device that can be hidden away and at $20 it's very affordable. \u2018The card is waterproof, so you could go swimming with it.\u2019 There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology, such as fingerprint scanners and  face scanners, to unlock their smartphones. The iPhone 6, for example, has Touch ID, which enables users to unlock their handset by placing their finger on a button for a couple of seconds, while Fujitsu recently unveiled an iris scanner at Mobile World Congress that uses infrared light to unlock a handset. But the pair of Salt card inventors say that phone unlocking is just the beginning for them and in the future, they hope to develop the idea as a platform for communicating with all sorts of electronic devices. 'One day we'd like the card to communicate with doors, unlocking as you approach them, lights turning on and off or you walk into a restaurant and you won't need to let them know you've arrived, it'll just book you in,\u00a0Mr Paglione said. There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN, instead using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanners and iris scanners (illustrated) to unlock their smartphones . Fujitsu has developed a \u2018custom compact and high-output infrared LED\u2019, and a custom infrared camera. These were combined with Fujitsu\u2019s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn\u2019t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye\u2019s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user.

Researchers found the bombardier beetle (pictured) mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' A beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci-fi film - or the stuff of nightmares. But researchers have discovered the Bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' in its stomach. When threatened, the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul-smelling liquid from its rear, complete with 'gun smoke'. It can even precisely aim the nozzle at the attacker. This behaviour has been caught on camera by Wendy Moore and her colleagues at the University of Arizona. Many beetles secrete foul-smelling or bad-tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators, but bombardier beetles take it a step further. When threatened, they combine chemicals in an explosive chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray. Assistant Professor Moore, from the Department of Entomology at the university, has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid-fire capabilities. 'Understanding how these beetles produce - and survive - repetitive explosions could provide new design principles for technologies such as blast mitigation and propulsion,' she said. The study was led by doctoral student Eric Arndt and Christine Ortiz in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Arndt and Ortiz teamed up with Professor Moore to study the anatomy of the beetle's reaction chamber, which is constructed of cuticle, a composite of chitin, proteins and waxes. The material, which also makes up the exoskeleton of insects, protects the beetle from the toxic chemicals, high temperatures and high pressures during explosions. A real hot shot! The research, including video footage (shown above) not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid-fire capabilities . The mechanism of the bombardier beetle's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies, relying on external observations, could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun. African bombardier beetles can accurately hit targets in any direction. Researchers at Cornell University snapped another type of Bombardier beetle, Stenaptinus insignis' attack in 1999, to reveal they use the explosive defensive mechanism to buy time when they are under attack. The beetle is quite vulnerable on the ground because unlike most insects such as bees and flies, it can't take off instantly. This means that the slow process of unfurling its wings could cost the insect its life if under attack from ants, for example. So it attacks its attackers in turn, giving it time to get airborne. The spray itself contains p-benzoquinones - compounds known for their irritant properties. The chemicals are stored separately in the creature's abdomen and then combine explosively, explaining why they are ejected at such high speed and at 100 C. 'Twenty-five years ago, a team of scientists from Cornell University and MIT discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses,' Assistant Professor Moore said. 'What wasn't known is what causes each discharge to be pulsed, like a machine gun. 'Previous researchers suggested that the pulses were caused by muscle contractions or by a fluttering of the exit duct during the explosions.' Using enzymes that digest muscle and fat, the researchers cleaned the reaction chamber, which enabled them to examine it under a microscope. While studying the shape of the reaction chamber, they noticed that some regions of the chamber wall were thin and not as strong as others, and that one region near the mixing valve looked particularly thin. They predicted that this thin cuticle would be displaced by the force of the reactions in such a way that it would impinge upon the valve - temporarily shutting off the flow of reactants. To investigate this hypothesis, the team directly observed the internal dynamics of spray pulsation in live Brachinus elongatulus beetles, a type of bombardier beetle, which is found throughout southern Arizona. Of 500 beetles, the researchers were able to record 30 discharges from 14 individuals. This was enough to provide high-definition, high-speed video of what happens inside a bombardier beetle's reaction chamber when it goes off. All guns blazing: 'Twenty-five years ago, a team of scientists from Cornell University and MIT discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses,' Assistant Professor Moore said, which led to the machine gun analogy. A stock image of a machine gun is shown . It turns out the pulses are generated in a passive way, not through an active process involving muscle contraction, as previously thought. As the chemicals pass through a valve into the reaction chamber, they mix with enzymes and explosively liberate oxygen gas, water vapor and heat, propelling a hot, noxious spray down the nozzle and out the exit pore. Each explosion inside the chamber forces a highly elastic region of the chamber wall - the thin cuticular area Moore found in her earlier dissections - to expand and impinge on the valve that separates the two chambers, temporarily cutting off the flow of reactants and resulting in a pulsed delivery. 'It turns out the expansion membrane of the reaction chamber acts as a passive closure mechanism, which is something that had not been described or even predicted before this study,' Professor Moore said. 'We also discovered that the chamber's anatomy varies between female and male beetles.' While it is still not completely clear why it might be beneficial to the beetle to have a pulsed delivery, she suspects that dividing the spray into very short, rapid pulses allows the beetle to sustain the energy of the blast and its small body size at the same time. 'By having a pulsed delivery, these small beetles produce a relatively large amount of defensive spray, which they can aim precisely and with great force and speed,' she said. 'This is truly one of the most remarkable and elegant defensive mechanisms documented to date.' When threatened, the bombardier beetle repeatedly fires streams of liquid from its rear, complete with 'gun smoke'. The expulsion of fluid is shown in the images above, which come from a 1999 study that found another bug, Stenaptinus insignis, uses its weapon to 'buy time' when under attack because it can't fly away .", "answer": "Bombardier beetle mimics machine gun using chemicals in its stomach .\nAs chemicals pass into the abdomen they mix with enzymes and explode .\nEach explosion causes the foul-smelling liquid to be forced from its rear .\nIt 'pulses' repeatedly from the beetle's rear - and the bug can even aim .", "completion": ["Researchers have discovered that the Bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal 'reaction chamber' in its stomach, allowing it to fire streams of foul-smelling liquid from its rear when threatened."]}

Last night the Metropolitan Police revealed that they had arrested a 61-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, after Leslie Cooper, 36 appeared at Camberwell Magistrates' Court yesterday. Officers visited An Noor, in Acton, to search for further clues in the killing of Mr Arwani, 48, who was an outspoken opponent of the Assad regime in his native country. The other address searched by police yesterday was Mr Mitchell's home in Wembley, which was cordoned off as police investigated the property. The 61-year-old, who is said to be a Muslim convert from Jamaica, is a trustee of An Noor and a director of the company which owns the site of the building. Neighbours said that Mr Mitchell, who is known as 'Bernie' or 'Khaled', was of Jamaican origin and became a Muslim several years ago.

{"input": "Mister Money is now putting his money where his mouth is. Floyd Mayweather has commissioned a mouthguard not only imbedded with his usual diamond and gold bling but stuffed with $100 bills. Total cost, according to his favourite website TMZ, is\u00a0$25,000. Floyd Mayweather (left) vs Manny Pacquiao in the official advert for their mega-fight on May 2 . Pay-per-view watchers in America will have to pay up to $100 (\u00a367.48) to watch the fight .

As the value of the richest fight of all time keeps rising ever closer to the half-billion mark, so does the value of Manny Pacquiao\u2019s target. If the PacMan does land the knockout blow, then given the expensive protection at least the Money Man should wake up smiling. Mayweather has just spent $300,000 on yet another vehicle, according to his favourite website TMZ. This is a Mercedes \u2018Land Yacht\u2019 people carrier to which he has added such extras as a 55-inch television and a champagne bar, to turn it into what he calls his \u2018Party Bus.\u2019 And so it turns out that all the time Andre Ward was talking about coming to England for a rematch with Carl Froch he was setting up yet another easy night out in his own backyard. Only a couple of days after the self-called Son of God declared he would be prepared to cross the Atlantic to face the Cobra, Ward revealed that his overdue ring comeback will be taking place in his California hometown on June 20. The opponent? Most likely a certain Marco Antonio Periban, who turned up in questionable condition to face James DeGale and was promptly knocked out in that final eliminator for Andre Dirrell\u2019s IBF super-middleweight title. Andre Ward is set to make his overdue ring comeback in his hometown on June 20 . So much for wanting to do it a second time with Froch to unify the WBA\u2019s two world championship belts. That fight had been ordered by the WBA and Froch\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn did his best to come to terms before the March 31 deadline . Now Ward\u2019s announcement has made it yet more likely that Froch might retire. Ward had claimed a readiness to overcome his phobia \u2013 either fear of flying or of fighting abroad. He wouldn\u2019t go as far as Froch\u2019s home city of Nottingham but he did express a willingness to travel to London for a showdown at either Wembley or the 02. His argument was that his US victory over Froch in the final of the Super Six super-middleweight tournament took place in Atlantic City, not Oakland. So London would be fairer than Nottingham. Still, Froch doubted he was serious and was apparently right to do so. It is back to home sweet home for Ward, at the Oracle Arena across the bay from San Francisco. If not exactly the offspring of the Almighty, Ward is a favourite son of American boxing. So the WBA appear compliant, with no sign yet of him being stripped of his belt. Foch is unlikely to get his dream fight against Ward or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Ward remains atop the ratings as their \u2018super\u2019 champion, with Froch still the \u2018regular\u2019 world titlist. Maybe the WBA are giving him license to shake off the ring rust after being out of the ring since his points win over another undistinguished foe, Edwin Rodriguez, way back in November 2013. Yet Ward\u2019s inactivity has long since become more a result of self-inflicted promotional disputes than his original injury. Now he is the first major signing by the new kids on that block, the music industry-backed Roc Nation, who are trying to confirm not only the opponent for June 20 but a TV deal. That the television rights have not been snapped up instantly by either of the major networks HBO or Showtime speaks to Ward\u2019s sluggish box office appeal despite the high professional regard for his skills. The closest he has come to properly fighting abroad has been a couple of low-key outings to the Caribbean. That he so much as contemplated travelling several thousand miles to face Froch indicates a realisation that he could make a lot more money in England. Still, that temptation is not enough. Not yet, anyway. He carries on talking about the Cobra later. But as it stands one of Froch\u2019s dreams for his farewell appearance \u2013 boxing at the City Ground home of Nottingham Forest \u2013 has been dashed. The other ambition \u2013 a fight in Las Vegas \u2013 hangs on Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr coming through an interim bout and agreeing to meet him there in September. But Froch says: \u2018Unless I get a fight that excites me soon I may well hang up the gloves.\u2019 Ward, meanwhile, talks about meeting the challenge of middleweight KO sensation Gennady Golovkin \u2018soon'. Floyd Mayweather says: \u2018For me, Andre beats him every day of the week.' The questions, Andre, are which day? And where? The IBF still insist that Amir Khan, who has yet to confirm Chris Algieri or anyone else as his May 30 opponent, turned down a fight with Tim Bradley as a final eliminator for Kell Brook\u2019s world welterweight title.

{"input": "She was the woman who inspired three of the greatest love songs of all time and was at the heart of the most famous love triangle in rock history. Married to both George Harrison and Eric Clapton, model Pattie Boyd was one of the most envied women in the world. Yesterday at the age of 71, she wed for a third time \u2013 with a soundtrack provided by her Irish terrier Freddie who did his best to upstage the bride and her new groom, property developer Rod Weston. Scroll down for video . Pattie Boyd has tied the knot for the third time, this time with Rod Weston at Chelsea Registry Office, Chelsea Old Town Hall, in London . Pattie, photographed with Rod and their dog Freddie, was famously married to both George Harrison and Eric Clapton in the past . The couple look delighted as their leave the town hall to a shower of confetti . The setting was very rock and roll; Chelsea Register Office on the King\u2019s Road, where so many of pop\u2019s leading men and women have married over the years. But that\u2019s where any similarity with Pattie\u2019s famous past began and ended. There were still splashes of style, of course, from the Bentley that took the happy couple to their wedding breakfast at the uber-trendy Beaumont Hotel in Mayfair to the presence of Pattie\u2019s fellow Sixties model Edina Ronay. But there were no groupies or hangers-on as there had been when she married Clapton in 1979 or Harrison in 1966 \u2013 just a handful of close friends and family who threw confetti as Pattie and Rod, who have been together almost 25 years, emerged from the cream-painted Rossetti Room arm in arm. And in a nod to the tradition of the bride wearing something borrowed, Patti wore a hat owned by her late friend Pat Booth, the model turned best-selling author who died of cancer in 2009. Friends of the couple, who live in Kensington, feared they would never tie the knot. \u2018It\u2019s almost our silver anniversary so we thought we had better get on with it,\u2019 said Weston, 61. George Harrison (who died in November 2001) and Pattie Boyd, 21, leave Epsom Registrar Office after their marriage in January 1966 . Eric Clapton married Pattie Boyd, the ex-wife of his friend George Harrison, in 1979 . Since settling down with Weston, Pattie, a former Vogue cover girl, has turned herself into an accomplished photographer and her pictures have been exhibited all over the world. With the death of John Lennon\u2019s ex-wife Cynthia last month, convent-educated Pattie is now the sole surviving first wife of a Beatle. Born in Somerset, she met Harrison on the set of A Hard Day\u2019s Night in 1964, when she was cast as a schoolgirl in The Beatles\u2019 first film. They were married two years later when she was 21 and Harrison, 22. He later wrote the song Something for her. It was by no means the only famous song composed for the bewitching beauty. The 70-year-old model, photographer and author, has found love for the third time with Weston . Pattie showcased her age-defying good looks and sartorial prowess in a chic silver and blue coat jacket and silver dress . She accessorised her look with silver sandals and an oversized hat, and carried a posy of flowers as her guests showered her and her new husband with confetti . Eric Clapton, who pursued her passionately, rhapsodised about her refusal to abandon Harrison for him with his anguished and electrifying hit Layla. He also wrote his most famous ballad, Wonderful Tonight, for her. In her 2007 memoir, Wonderful Today, Pattie broke 35 years of silence to describe how after years of mutual anguish which pushed Clapton to the brink of a drug-induced breakdown, she eventually left Harrison to marry Clapton. Her affair with the guitarist started in 1970 after he played Layla to her for the first time. She said: \u2018He played it to me two or three times, all the while watching my face intently for my reaction. My first thought was, \u201cOh God, everyone\u2019s going to know this is about me.\u2019\u2019 Pattie, now 71, met property developer Rod back in 1991 and he became her long-term partner . Pattie with her mother and Diana and sister Jenny at her wedding on Thursday . Pattie, who has graced the cover of Vogue numerous times, and had three of arguably the greatest love songs ever written for her, has had some of the most high-profile relationships of all time . The first time that Pattie tied the knot was to George Harrison in January 1966 and legend Paul McCartney was best man . \u2018I was married to Eric\u2019s close friend George Harrison, but Eric had been making his desire for me clear for months. \u2018But with the realisation that I had inspired such passion and creativity, the song got the better of me.

{"input": "There is a passage in Diego Torres\u2019s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea\u2019s manager. In the English version of Torres\u2019s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later. Here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, when Ronaldo had made it clear he expected Los Blancos to be more adventurous in the Bernabeu. Jose Mourinho makes a point to Oscar and his Brazilian team-mate Willian during a game at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before, by Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid . Oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at Stoke, where he was replaced at half time . Oscar hasn't completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since mid-January. Here is is full recent record: . Jan 31 Manchester City (substituted, 89) Feb 7 Aston Villa (substituted, 73) Feb 11 Everton (unused) Feb 17 Paris Saint Germain (substitute, 83) Feb 21 Burnley (substituted, 72) Mar 1 Tottenham (substitute, 88) Mar 4 West Ham (substituted, 74) Mar 11 Paris Saint Germain (substituted, 45) Mar 15 Southampton (substituted, 82) Mar 22 Hull (substitute, 61) Apr 4 Stoke (substituted, 45) According to Torres, the Real Madrid coach told his star player: \u2018I\u2019m going to say it to your face: you complain that we play defensively. But do you know why we play this way? For you. \u2018Because, as you don\u2019t want to defend or cover the wings, I have to have the team sitting deep... when you come on, you do your own thing.\u2019 That meeting, held in the presence of the great Zinedine Zidane, apparently lasted 40 minutes. Real Madrid drew the second leg 1-1 and Barcelona progressed to the final, where they beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley. Team meetings are a theme of Mourinho\u2019s management, giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season. It is a pragmatic approach, one to be admired, unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges Mourinho\u2019s coaching philosophy. You cannot blame Oscar, the current fall-guy, for encouraging Chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of January. When you can call upon Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian, why wouldn\u2019t you? Oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks, failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on January 27. The Brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games . Mourinho demands that the likes of Oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free Eden Hazard's flair . The Brazilian forward has not completed a Barclays Premier League match since the 5-0 victory at Swansea City, where he scored twice for the league leaders, 10 days earlier. Oscar put Chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the Liberty Stadium and his second, when he beat Swansea keeper Lukas Fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area, is the last time he has scored. Since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup at Stamford Bridge, Oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of Chelsea\u2019s last 11 fixtures. Here is the record in full. Manchester City (substituted, 89); Aston Villa (substituted, 73); Paris Saint-Germain (substitute, 83); Burnley (substituted, 72); Tottenham (substitute, 88); West Ham (substituted, 74); Paris Saint-Germain (substituted, 45); Southampton (substituted, 82); Hull (substitute, 61); Stoke (substituted, 45). Against Everton, on February 11, he was not in the squad. Naturally Oscar has some concerns, worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers. Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards . The Chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against Stoke . It is believed to have been innocuous, an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the Chelsea dressing room since his move from Internacional in 2012. He is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker. It was Oscar, after all, who is so highly-regarded by the coaching staff at Chelsea that he was considered a potential, future rival to the annual duel between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d\u2019Or. When Oscar returned from the World Cup, where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7-1 rout by Germany in the semi-final, his first-class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff. Despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team, he was eager to please Mourinho as he entered his third season with Chelsea. In November, his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five-year contract, a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker, Diego Costa, until 2019. All was well. Oscar was dejected after Brazil's World Cup semi final defeat, but he returned to Chelsea with a good attitude . The Chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of Eden Hazard and Willian . When Oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future Ballon d'Or winner, but his place is now in doubt . There is a touch of Brian Clough about Mourinho\u2019s attitude towards him, a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players. \u2018We talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide I was right all along,\u2019 Clough once remarked. Oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with Mourinho\u2019s mood swings. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think he had a bad performance, I just think his performance was not good enough, which is a huge difference,\u2019 claimed Chelsea\u2019s manager after their 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday. Naturally there is a little uncertainty about Oscar\u2019s performances at the moment, reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences. Oscar knows, like everyone else knows, that if you take on Mourinho, he will take you off.", "answer": "Oscar spoke up against defensive Chelsea tactics in a team meeting .\nCristiano Ronaldo made a similar point to Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid .\nBrazilian midfielder Oscar has not completed 90 minutes in last 11 games .\nMourinho criticised Oscar publicly after Stoke game .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Chelsea news .", "completion": ["Chelsea's manager, Jose Mourinho, is known for his pragmatic approach and team meetings, but players who challenge his coaching philosophy, like Oscar, often find themselves sidelined, as seen in Oscar's recent lack of full 90-minute games since he encouraged Chelsea to play with more adventure."]}
{"input": "Sporting America fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura. The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National .

As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father\u2019s words: \u2018Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.\u2019 So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. \u2018He\u2019s just a class guy in every way and it\u2019s difficult not to root for him,\u2019 said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . \u2018This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.\u2019 Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: \u2018Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He\u2019s polite, he\u2019s humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he\u2019s obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.\u2019 The one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Hardly a day goes by when Spieth does not Facetime Ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet. \u2018I\u2019ll finally be able to tell her yes,\u2019 he said, smiling. When Spieth speaks about Ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice, only joy, laughter and pride. \u2018I know she was watching on television and I think she\u2019s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,\u2019 he said. \u2018She\u2019s going to want a present.\u2019 Golf should not have been Spieth\u2019s game at all. Nobody in the family plays \u2014 they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. Spieth (front) is presented with his green jacket by last year's Masters champion Bubba Watson . Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie after a sensational victory at the Masters . Perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the University of Texas after his first year. It was well-meaning. By the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the US Open, finishing 21st. But why the hurry? Why not complete his education? Throughout his life Spieth has known exactly what he wants \u2014 from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie Michael Greller. He is a maths teacher by trade but Spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway. Spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13million (\u00a38.86m) on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: \u2018I don\u2019t see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,\u2019 it does not come across as at all boastful. Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Asked about McIlroy, as ever, he found exactly the right words: \u2018He\u2019s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that\u2019s something I can only dream about. I\u2019ll never hit it like he does and I have to make up for that somewhere else. But I\u2019m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games.\u2019 How on earth did golf get this lucky? A sport with a fuddy-duddy, middle-aged image? Consider this: the world\u2019s top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis. The game is very fortunate to have a man like McIlroy. It is doubly lucky to have a personable 17-year-old in Lydia Ko at the top of the women\u2019s game. Now Spieth has come along and golf feels truly blessed. Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . It was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the Masters that English golf had reached the end of an era, with no players ranked in the world\u2019s top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008. But, following the encouraging events at Augusta, there should be good days ahead. Three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation, with Ian Poulter and Paul Casey (tied sixth) doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out. As for joint runner-up Justin Rose, whose 14-under-par total would have won 74 out of 79 Masters, here\u2019s a prediction: over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 US Open win. England's Justin Rose on the 18th green on Sunday after finishing tied for second on 14-under-par . Driving . No contest here.

It\u2019s still McIlroy for me but we have to remember he is four years older, and Spieth has been a pro for less than two years. The exciting thing for the game, and the frightening thing for everyone else, is they\u2019re both so young in golf terms and clearly only going to get better in years to come.

{"input": "What we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of Nico Rosberg as a racing driver. His reaction to losing to Lewis Hamilton \u2013 blaming the Brit for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel closed on him \u2013 told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of Hamilton. Rosberg was, I thought, disgruntled by his failure to match his team-mate during a run of eight wins in the last 10 races. In those emotionally charged minutes after the Chinese Grand Prix nothing seemed to make sense to him, rational thought was fuzzy and Hamilton appeared in his mind as a blurry figure of hate. Nico Rosberg (left) looks less than impressed after finishing second to Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton . The German driver\u00a0blamed Hamilton for slowing down and bunching him up as Sebastian Vettel closed in . Rosberg (left), Hamilton (second right) and Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel celebrate on the podium in China . It was all the more remarkable given that Rosberg was for so much of last season the ultimate expression of focus, coolness, intelligence and calculation. There was no chink in his well-tailored shell of composure. That changed in the aftermath of Spa last August, when Rosberg was punished by the team (he was made to pay for the damage caused rather than fined as such, contrary to everyone\u2019s interpretation at the time) for his part in an early crash with Hamilton. Rosberg's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with Hamilton in Spa last August . It was my view then and remains so that Rosberg was marginally more to blame for the collision, but that it was no more than a racing incident. The stewards agreed. They did not penalise either man. Yet, Mercedes made Rosberg a very public scapegoat, denting his confidence at a crucial moment in the season. He shrunk. Hamilton immediately seized the initiative, which he has never ceded in the slightest measure from that day to this. When on form, Hamilton is an extraordinary racer, maybe utterly unbeatable. And he is on form now, perhaps more so than ever in his life. That must eat at Rosberg\u2019s heart. I am not writing off the German quite yet. I believe he is far tougher than his nickname Britney, as in Spears, suggests. He can be \u2018nasty\u2019 as Niki Lauda said of him. We can all recall examples of his cunning. But he is at a fork in his career, it seems. For if he cannot find a way to beat Hamilton soon, he could ebb away as Mark Webber did at Red Bull. Webber, a feisty competitor and a talented driver, was a genuine threat to Vettel in their first season fighting for the title, as Rosberg was to Hamilton in their intitial championship contest. But that was it for Webber. Vettel soon took total command, and his one-time rival was left to complain about his supposedly unfair treatment by the team, before fading into the distance and finally into retirement from Formula One. The 17-year-old Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Max Verstappen showed he has what it takes . My highlight of the Chinese Grand Prix was the pure, instinctive racing of Max Verstappen. His ability to go on the inside of his prey and brake at precisely the last moment was remarkable craftsmanship from a boy of 17. It reminded me of John Arlott\u2019s tribute when a young, floppy haired David Gower began his England Test career with a nonchalant four. \u2018Oh, what a princely entry,\u2019 he growled. Bernie Ecclestone recently highlighted that commentators 'don\u2019t fully understand' technical terms . Formula One has a greater than average obsession with its own navel. It never stops asking where it can improve itself to an extent that must bore any outsider to distraction. Over complicating the whole sport is an associated abomination that has increased in recent years through saturation coverage on television and the internet. Every smart aleck wants to show just how clever he is, however slight his underlying knowledge of the sport may be. Bernie Ecclestone recently picked up on this phenomenon, saying: \u2018Commentators explain for an expert audience and not for people wanting to have an entertaining afternoon in front of their tellies. \u2018And many times these commentators hide behind technical terms because they themselves don\u2019t fully understand what is going on. There you have it.\u2019 The nadir of this nerdy jargon is surely the description of tyres as \u2018prime\u2019 and \u2018option\u2019, terms that even the suppliers, Pirelli, wanted discontinued. So, to clarify: super soft tyres are always known as the \u2018option\u2019 tyres, when they are in use, which they are not always; softs can be \u2018prime\u2019 or \u2018option\u2019, so can mediums, though hards are \u2018prime\u2019 whenever they are available, which they are not always.

{"input": "Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with his latest column for Sportsmail. The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. TAKING THE BISCUIT . Just a few days ago an old friend of mine Jimmy Carter, the winger who played for Millwall, Liverpool and Arsenal not the US President, visited Barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office. After training, to help me get rid of them, I decided to give some out to our players. The first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of PG Tips and a chat. I asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on, around the group. I kept repeating it, each time: Take one and pass it on, take one and pass it on. One player didn\u2019t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on. Martin Allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. I stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadn\u2019t taken a biscuit. This was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach\u2019s direction. I didn\u2019t tell them to eat it - I told them to take one and pass the pack on. The other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead. I passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit. I let them all know they could eat if they like, and if not return it to my desk, and shook all their hands as they left the room. When it comes to this crucial stage in the season, you need all your troops ready to follow orders. IT\u2019S A ZAYN IF THEY\u2019RE NOT PULLING IN ONE DIRECTION . At whatever level it\u2019s always important to have all your players going in One Direction. Just like the band, if you\u2019ve got one person wanting to go a different way, do a different thing, something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken. At the business end of the season, it is so important that they are working as a team. People have to do their jobs; defending set plays, defensive shape when you\u2019re attacking, working up and down the pitch. You need good captains and leaders within your group. People like John Terry, who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that Chelsea squad follows Jose Mourinho\u2019s guidance out on the pitch. It is One Direction, or no direction. Captain John Terry works hard to ensure everybody at Chelsea is heading in the same direction . ON THE PERIPHERY . Having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important. But the players out of the team, on the periphery, can lose you matches. Negative body language, people unable to cope with not playing, disruptive comments, and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad. The man-management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the UEFA Pro Licence or courses put on by the Football Association. I\u2019ve spent the last three-and-a-half years working with a guy called Rob Northfield, who runs Inspire based up in Harrogate, on man-management skills for my players, my staff and of course myself. He deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies. Allen won a championship with Gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with Barnet . Since then, I have one championship in the bag at Gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month would\u2019ve bagged a second. Without Rob Northfields this would not have happened. Mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side. He knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him. Players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing. Allen\u2019s Analysis\u2026 . One person I keep hearing about\u2026 Gary Rowett Gary Rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at Birmingham City. He has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the Championship. He did a tremendous job at Burton Albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind, having played against his teams over the last couple of years, he would go on to manage at a much higher level. He must've asked me at least one hundred questions when my Gillingham team visited Burton the week after winning the championship. He was like Bamber Gascoigne, the old University Challenge presenter - non-stop firing questions at me. He was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with Gillingham from a team that had previously been mid-table. For me, he\u2019s heading for the top. Allen believes Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is going to go all the way to the top . One thing I\u2019d change about\u2026 perceptions in football . At Barnet last summer, I found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people. I took on Jon Nurse, born in Barbados, as a player-coach. I was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother. On top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games, winning a promotion, the FA Trophy and been in numerous playoff finals. He also has a UEFA B coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called Love The Ball. I took on another player-coach, goalkeeper Graham Stack, an Irishman, who has four impeccably behaved children, who runs the Graham Stack Soccer Academy for youngsters and a high-end executive travel company with his wife, who can build patios and brick walls alongside his UEFA B coaching licence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has been working alongside Allen as a coach at Barnet . Then I was introduced to a young man called Omar Yabroudi who moved to London from Dubai and wanted to be my analyst. He works hard and has been a real help. He works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly. We have a 23-year-old female physiotherapist, Jade Cook, who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time. She is calm, quiet, well-organised, disciplined, structured and I am very happy all the players are being so well looked after. I did not take on a Barbadian, an Irishman, an Emirati or a female because of their nationality, or skin colour or gender. I took them on because they\u2019re good at their jobs, they are good people, with good personalities and they have excellent characters.

When I was a little boy watching England versus Poland in the front room with my dad, the amazing Jan Tomaszewski, who Brian Clough called a \u2018clown in gloves,\u2019 stopped England qualifying for the 1974 World Cup with his heroic performance in goal. The panel of pundits, all those years ago, said we\u2019ve got to change. We\u2019re not playing the type of football other countries play; our children don\u2019t get coached to be good technical players like other nations. Over the years I\u2019ve heard it time and time again. The same old stuff. Especially over the last few years with the Spanish dominance, people asking why we have not got the Iniestas and Xavis of this world on our shores. Allen believes Greg Dyke is the man to help find the Iniestas and Xavis of the English game . The Football Association\u2019s technical director now, Dan Ashworth, appointed by my old chairman Greg Dyke, is a forward-thinker who can finally make some changes. He may never have played a professional game in his life, but at West Bromwich Albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club, where the manager does not have to deal with everything, where other departments and professionals are involved. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . Ashworth can handle himself well. At a League Managers Association training day a couple of years, at a hotel near Reading, one Sunday afternoon, speaking just before Fabio Capello, Ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical, old-fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward. The gave him a torrid time with their caveman-like mentality that the manager should run the whole club. He handled the room carefully and skilfully and I think Greg Dyke has put English football into the right hands.

{"input": "Richie Benaud made commentary look easy. Believe me, it isn\u2019t. But he put in the hard work and he rose to the top. There\u2019s a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today. I had the great honour of doing a stint on Channel 9 in Australia during an Ashes Test a few years ago. They\u2019d only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and, as usual, Richie was keeping his contributions to a minimum. I mean that in a good way \u2014 again, another lesson for today\u2019s batch. Anyway, Richie had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch, so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him. He wanted some footage of an incident he\u2019d spotted a couple of overs earlier \u2014 Shane Warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his later years in August 2005 . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . Finally, the producer located what he wanted. Warne, who hadn\u2019t bowled yet \u2014 but who would go on to skittle England for the umpteenth time \u2014 had picked up his bowling marker, a small white disc, and thrown it to where he thought he\u2019d be starting his run-up. Between overs, they broadcast Warne\u2019s gesture. Richie said: \u2018Shane Warne\u2019s just put a marker down.\u2019 That was his only contribution in the half-hour we were on together, but it beat anything else we had to offer. One line! It was classic Richie: he had the eagle eye to see what Warne was doing in the first place, the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on, and the perfect choice of words. As he might have put it himself: marvellous. I thought of Richie during the World Cup final last month. For some reason Star Sports, the tournament\u2019s global broadcasters, used a team of rookies to commentate on the match. Some of them were among the game\u2019s greatest modern-day players, but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary. It was terrible TV. They just couldn\u2019t pinpoint the moment \u2014 no emotion, no elation, no despair. How we missed Richie that evening. He never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his. Sometimes he could be very understated indeed. David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . Australia cricket legend Benaud shakes hands with HM Queen Elizabeth II during his playing days . I remember talking to Michael Slater, who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years. He spoke about one day when Richie did two half-hour stints as one of three commentators, and did not say a single word. Slats described it as \u2018bagging a pair\u2019, the term for a batsman who gets two ducks. But that was Richie. If there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see, he wouldn\u2019t add to it. It really pains me now, for example, when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see. It might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground, or something similar, and they just read out the list! It\u2019s incredibly lazy. Richie would consider the list, and then say something like: \u2018And No 4 could soon be moving to No 2.\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t even name names \u2014 he respected the intelligence of the viewer. And I know how much viewers responded to that. One of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight. He wasn\u2019t in it for the ego. He\u2019d turn up in the commentary box and if he was off-air, he\u2019d set up at the back of the box, take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene, or look up the latest horseracing odds. The chemistry he had with the likes of Tony Greig and Bill Lawry was amazing. It was unmissable. And it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his leg spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . And, boy, he loved the game. One evening, Richie, Ron Atkinson and I were treated to dinner in Birmingham by the News of the World, who we were all working for at the time. Ron was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening. Richie wasn\u2019t a big drinker, but he\u2019d allowed himself a couple of glasses of red, and he started telling this story about the great Australian leg-spinner Bill O\u2019Reilly. It\u2019s fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time Ron had disappeared into the night and Richie was being bundled into a waiting taxi, we were still learning all about Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2026 . He had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him. He didn\u2019t really go in for after-dinner speaking, but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words. Once he spotted me in the audience, and quickly remembered the time I was hit in the groin by Jeff Thomson (have I mentioned that before?). Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . \u2018Ah, there\u2019s David Lloyd,\u2019 Richie said. \u2018I remember him telling me in 1974-75 how he could play Thommo with his c***\u2026 and then he proceeded to do precisely that.\u2019 The joke was all in the pause and the timing. He was a great leg-spinner, a superb captain, and a lovely bloke. I can just imagine how warmly he\u2019ll be welcomed by some of the other great commentators up in the sky: Brian Johnston, Alan McGilvray, John Arlott, even Freddie Trueman. Fred was often known to splutter: \u2018I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going off out there.\u2019 Richie, it\u2019s safe to say, never suffered from the same affliction. We\u2019ll miss him dearly. And so will cricket. ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.'

{"input": "Congratulations to Australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas. It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react. Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players, no matter where in the world they ply their trade. If Roy Hodgson\u2019s star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona, would the FA tell him not to pick them? Absolutely not. The same needs to apply to rugby. Matt Giteau's stellar displays for Toulon have put him back on the Wallabies radar ahead of the World Cup . The game is changing and Australia have realised that. Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell, for example, are top-class performers for Toulon and if England lose to Australia with those two playing out of their skins, you know exactly what the headlines will be. The World Cup is simply about the world\u2019s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it. Toulon\u2019s Steffon Armitage came off the bench against Leinster on Sunday and turned the game on its head. His turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to France his game has constantly improved. Toulon's Steffon Armitage takes on the Leinster defence during the Champions Cup semi-final in Marseille . I don\u2019t think Armitage would be playing this well if he was still at London Irish. He took a big risk and it paid off, he shouldn\u2019t be penalised for it. If one or two England back-rowers wouldn\u2019t want to see Armitage in the squad, then that confirms he should be! Nick Abendanon has also become better since he crossed the Channel. It\u2019s simply wrong to say England are best served by players at English clubs. If someone is going to be happier, healthier and a better player overseas, he should be supported. Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better than when he played for England, so that completes the argument for me. Would I have picked Jonny if he was playing in France? Of course I would. Nick Abendanon's game has drastically improved since the former Bath full back made the move to France . As England coach you will be judged on your World Cup performance, even more so as the home team. That\u2019s where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting XV is the first thing you have to get right, without exception. When it comes to the big games, the other England players will want to have the best possible squad available. Every player, fan and Englishman wants England to win the World Cup and it starts with picking your best team. When it comes to a home World Cup, you don\u2019t want to be left talking about \u2018what ifs\u2019. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players . England players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning. Do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered? They shouldn\u2019t be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address. This isn\u2019t about being disloyal to the clubs. They benefit from a winning England team, especially in a World Cup year. You simply can\u2019t let the RFU or Premier Rugby tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or can\u2019t pick. At Toulon, they\u2019ve got Bryan Habana playing for South Africa and Leigh Halfpenny playing for Wales. They\u2019re among the best players in the world. It\u2019s just crazy and misguided not to make any Englishman available for selection. Well done, Australia.

{"input": "It's normally Steffon Armitage who triggers it, but this time it is Nick Abendanon\u2019s doing. He played so well for Clermont Auvergne last weekend \u2013 again \u2013 that England\u2019s policy against picking players based abroad is back in focus. For the umpteenth time, the RFU and Stuart Lancaster are being urged to invoke the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 get-out clause. There is an assumption in many quarters that, this being a World Cup year, it is time to abandon all principles and do whatever it takes to ensure that every Englishman, wherever he may be, is available for selection. Well, here\u2019s an alternative suggestion. Scrap the clause. Now. It is proving to be more hassle than it is worth. Lancaster, his assistants and his employers are being stalked by calls for Armitage to be called into the national squad, as befitting his supreme exploits for Toulon. But that is to ignore the coaches\u2019 reservations, and the realisation that the fall-out from a shift in policy would have long-term repercussions. Former Bath full back Nick Abendanon was outstanding for Clermont as they tore Saracens to shreds . Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage has been one of the standout forwards in Europe in recent seasons . Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea believes the 'exceptional' clause could cause major problems . England hooker Tom Youngs also thinks the clause could create tension in the current international set-up . This is not to decry a quality flanker who has excelled among the Galacticos at his club, but this situation cannot go on. England are being held hostage by their own edict, so why not just ditch the \u2018exceptional\u2019 clause and end the out-cry? Critics of the union\u2019s stance over-look the consequences for the club game in this country if there is no restriction in place. This column concurs with Conor O\u2019Shea, who said: \u2018It is pure populism to say it is World Cup year and we should do anything we can because the minute you break that (policy), you break the dam. There are always exceptional circumstances. Then there will be the next one and the next one and the next one.\u2019 Leicester\u2019s England hooker, Tom Youngs added: \u2018I don\u2019t know how well it would go down with the team. Stuart has built a culture with this group of players. Does he want to disrupt it?\u2019 The 'exceptional' clause rule has continued to heap pressure on Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff . Fair point. Tell players they have to stay to be considered, then at the 11th hour perform a U-turn and select exiles; that is a short-cut to unrest, surely? This is no restraint of trade either \u2013 those who wish to go abroad can do so freely, but the knock-on effect is clear. Well, it is reasonably clear. It would be clearer still if the RFU and England really had the courage of their convictions and abolished the clause entirely. Sam Burgess\u2019s heavily-scrutinised conversion to rugby union will take an intriguing twist on Friday night, when he starts at blindside flanker for Bath against Newcastle at Kingston Park. He has been striving to make an impact in midfield for four months, but his club\u2019s head coach, Mike Ford, insisted long ago that back row would be his ultimate home. There are potential implications for Burgess\u2019s quest to earn a place in England\u2019s World Cup squad, as Lancaster sees him as a candidate to play at inside centre. Sam Burgess's rugby evolution continues on Friday as he starts at blindside flanker against Newcastle . However, despite widespread misgivings about the former league icon\u2019s exploits to date in his new code, he will be included in England\u2019s training squad announced next month, providing he is fit. That is a given. In addition, any further doubts about Manu Tuilagi\u2019s health will further enhance Burgess\u2019s prospects of making it to the World Cup \u2013 as a powerful ball-carrier who can break tackles and off-load. The England coaches will back themselves to mould him to their vision, given three months to do so. Finally, the back-row experiment makes sense. Burgess needs the ball in his hands more, in order to make his presence felt, so wearing No 6 addresses that. When it comes to matchday atmosphere, the\u00a0Stade Marcel Michelin is hard to beat . It is well documented that English clubs cannot compete with their French rivals when it comes to transfer-market clout, but they are also being eclipsed in the atmosphere stakes too. Last weekend, the cacophony at Stade Marcel Michelin \u2013 for Clermont vs Northampton \u2013 was on a different level to anything experienced here. In this observer\u2019s opinion, the noise and colour at Stade Felix Mayol the next day, as Wasps took on holders Toulon, was similar, if not quite as relentlessly raucous. Many Premiership grounds are full, but they lack the constant bedlam to be found in the best Gallic arenas. The Millennium Stadium when a big Test is on takes some beating, while Thomond Park, Limerick, is the spiritual home of supporter fanaticism, closely followed by Ravenhill when Ulster play under lights. Munster's home stadium Thomond Park is another fortress that generates a unique atmosphere . But Clermont lead the atmosphere league table. It\u2019s not necessarily a great place to go in support of doomed visitors, but those who haven\u2019t been should try it as neutrals, for a big French Top 14 clash. The place produces an epic occasion founded on fervent civic pride. CORBISIERO'S STRUGGLES RAISE DOUBTS . When certain players go down in pain and require treatment on the field, there is a particular sense of foreboding. Alex Corbisiero is in that category. The Northampton prop didn\u2019t feature for England during the recent Six Nations and was forced off during the Saints\u2019 thumping defeat at Clermont last weekend, apparently suffering discomfort in his right knee \u2013 which has been a problem area before. More recently, the Lions loosehead was laid low with a shoulder injury and he could be seen flexing that joint at Stade Marcel Michelin. Corbisiero hasn\u2019t started a Test for England for 28 months. His club insist this latest setback is \u2018only a bruise\u2019, but there will be grave doubts about this world-class player\u2019s ability to scale the heights again, until he plays regularly without mishap. Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero has not started a game for England in nearly two years . Saints and England lock Courtney Lawes is a doubt for his side's clash with Exeter on Sunday . Courtney Lawes has what Northampton are calling a \u2018bad shoulder\u2019 and may not feature in Sunday\u2019s clash with Exeter. There was better news for Saracens on Thursday, as Jacques Burger will be available for their Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont, after escaping with a one-match ban for striking Maxime Machenaud of Racing Metro. LAST WORD . Now that he has been duly confirmed as one of the 12 referees appointed for the World Cup, Nigel Owens should just go ahead and book his room in the Twickenham area for the final on October 31.

Claire says seeing \u2018Anthony\u2019 leave left her \u2018heartbroken\u2019. McCoy poses with his father Peader and two sisters Rosin and Jane at Limerick racecourse . She admits she still can\u2019t believe her boy stuck it out at Bolger\u2019s academy for four and a half years. But the steely, dogged determination that enabled her son to not just re-write racing\u2019s history books but tear them up and start again was already in evidence. Claire said: \u2018It was 25 years ago this week that he left to go to Jim Bolger\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t even 16. It was a beautiful day, like today, and I was heartbroken.

I could hardly wait until his father came home and part of me thought Anthony would maybe not go and come back. \u2018You couldn't do that now \u2013 can you imagine a 15 year-old going away? \u2018We had been down there before and left Anthony for a couple of weeks.

Another Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy\u2019s heroes from his childhood. \u2018Jim Bolger\u2019s gallops were 1,500ft above sea level \u2013 it was the wilds of Ireland and the most beautiful setting for animals you ever saw in your life but I would not have said that for the apprentices. \u2018They weren\u2019t living in luxury. The horses were living in more luxury than them. \u2018There was one public phone box and maybe 30 of them. It was a tough time.

It was a moment captured by Irish photographer Pat Healy. He said: \u2018I knew AP\u2019s father Peadar. He had bred Thumbs Up (winner of the County Hurdle at the 1993 Cheltenham Festival) and I knew him from point-to-points.

Much as she tried Claire could not get her son to concentrate on school. She says: \u2018I might as well have tried to persuade a cat \u2013 he was never, ever going to stay at school .

McCoy and his mother Claire pose after he announced his impending retirement at Leopardstown . \u2018Him and I fell out and we argued. I threatened to no avail.

But he stuck it out. He is a very focused man. We speak a lot on the phone \u2013 not about racing, just every day normal things.

With Claire and Peadar at Sandown will be their other son Colm and daughters Anne Marie, Jane, Kelly and Roisin.

{"input": "Doctors have called for under-fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight. The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside. Scroll down for video . Dame Sally Davies, the country's chief medical officer, who has ordered a cost review into giving all under-fours free vitamin D supplements . Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS. 'Sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. 'The outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs.' Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs, pictured, and a curvature of the spine . Rickets, which is also known as soft bones, can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine. During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. Figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition  in the financial year 2012-13. Professor Davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children. A scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of Birmingham handing out supplements, which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. She said: 'We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too.' The NHS already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the NHS\u2019s means-tested Healthy Start scheme. Professor Davies said the UK\u2019s record on children\u2019s health used to be \u2018one of the best but we are now the worst\u2019. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight \u2013 which the body needs to make vitamin D \u2013 and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.", "answer": "Dame Sally Davies has ordered review into cost of giving out free vitamins .\nComes after a rise in the number of cases of rickets in children in the UK .\nIncrease is being put down to fact children spend less time outside playing .\nRickets can cause bone deformities such as bowed legs and a curved spine .", "completion": ["Doctors are urging for free vitamins for children under four due to a rise in rickets cases, caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and lack of sunlight exposure, with the UK's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, ordering a cost review into providing all under-fours with free vitamin D supplements."]}
{"input": "Homicide conviction: Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, arrives for verdicts at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju, South Korea . The South Korean ferry captain responsible for a sinking that killed more than 300 people has had his sentence increased to life in prison. Lee Joon-seok had been ordered to serve 36 years in prison for negligence and abandoning passengers aboard the Sewol, by a district court following last year's disaster. But this was increased to life in prison today by an appellate court that convicted him of homicide by account of his 'willful negligence'. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year, killing 304 people. Most of the victims were teenagers who were en route to a southern island for a school trip. Victims' relatives criticised the original verdict which had acquitted him of homicide, saying it was too lenient. But his sentence was increased because the Gwangju High Court additionally convicted him on the homicide charges while upholding most of other charges that led to his November conviction, according to a court statement. The appellate court sentenced 14 other navigation crew members to 18 months to 12 years in prison, the statement said. In November they had received sentences of five to 30 years in prison. The court said it decided on Lee's homicide conviction because he fled the ship without making any evacuation order though he, as a captain, is required by law to take some measures to rescue his passengers. Lee's behavior was 'homicide by willful negligence,' the court judged. 'For whatever excuses, it's difficult to forgive Lee Joon-seok's action that caused a big tragedy,' the court statement cited the verdict as saying. Lee and the 14 crew members have been the subject of fierce public anger because they were among the first people rescued from the ship when it began badly listing on the day of the sinking in April last year.

Devastating: A girl is rescued from the stricken vessel while relatives grieve for the victims of the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, whose captain has today been jailed for life . Lee has said he issued an evacuation order, but the court statement said two of the 14 crew members acknowledged that there was no evacuation order. Many student survivors have said they were repeatedly ordered over a loudspeaker to stay on the sinking ship and that they didn't remember there any evacuation orders made by crew members before they helped each other to flee the ship. Judges sit to preside over verdicts for the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol's crew members who are charged with negligence and abandonment of passengers in the disaster at Gwangju High Court in Gwangju . Court spokesman Jeon Ilho said both prosecutors and the crew members have one week to appeal the verdicts. Lee Joon-seok, the captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, was sentenced to life in prison . A year after sinking, 295 bodies have been retrieved but nine others are missing. There is still lingering public criticism against the government over its handling of the sinking, the country's deadliest maritime disaster in decades. Violence occurred during a Seoul rally led by relatives and their supporters earlier this month, leaving dozens of people injured. Last week, South Korea formally announced it would salvage the ship from the ocean floor off the country's southwest coast. Relatives of the victims hope that might locate the missing, including four students, and help reveal more details about the sinking. Some experts are skeptical about those wishes and remain opposed to spending taxpayer's money to lift the civilian vessel. Officials say the salvage job is estimated to cost \u00a368 million and take 12 to 18 months. Authorities blame excessive cargo, improper storage, botched negligence and other negligence for the sinking, and have arrested about 140 people. Critics say higher-level officials haven't been accountable.", "answer": "Lee Joon-seok had sentence extended from 36 years to life in jail .\nJudge ruled his actions were 'homicide by willful negligence'\nHe was one of the first rescued and never ordered evacuation .\nMost victims of the Sewol disaster were high school students .\nFollows protests from victims families who are calling for ship to be raised .", "completion": ["The captain of the sunken South Korean ferry Sewol, Lee Joon-seok, has had his sentence increased to life in prison for a sinking that killed over 300 people, after an appellate court convicted him of homicide due to his 'willful negligence'."]}

The Arab kingdom has sent millions of dollars to arm and train their fighters so they can defeat the Syrian regime and 'increasingly powerful Jihadi organisations', according to the Guardian. Known as the Army of Islam, the insurgent group was created in 2011 when Saudi Arabia allegedly engineered the merger of over 50 rebel factions after growing alarmed at the rise if Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. It is a fierce enemy of both those Islamist groups as well as Jabhat Al-Nusra, but embraces independent rebel forces and 'non-Jihadi' units. Their graduation ceremony for  trainee soldiers in the Ghouta suburb of Damascus was attended by the militants' leadership who watch proudly as their troops march in perfect unison across the expanse.

Fierce: His fighters, who marched in perfect unison in Damascus, are waging a battle against ISIS in Syria and have reportedly attacked their headquarters in the Lebanese city of Arsal . The Salafist leader is considered one of the most power military chiefs in rebel-held Syria and called for the 'cleansing' of all Alawite and Shiites in Damascus. He says to his soldiers: 'Today, legions of Mujahadin, stand in readiness to raise the banner of Allah, uphold his words, move forward to fight and defend his religion. 'Know paradise is waiting for us since we either achieve victory or die in honour... So take your strength from Allah and wage Jihad in the cause of your Lord. 'We will leave these fields in which we finished our course and preparation and we will continue waging Jihad.'

The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca\u2019s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar\u2019s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant \u2013 to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Luis Enrique\u2019s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn\u2019t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts.

Local official Mowaffaq Hamid al-Azawi described the city of Mosul as a big open-air prison, where residents are subjected to barbaric torture at the hands of the ISIS terrorists. The news comes as the jihadis reportedly executed 60 Sunni tribal fighters in Iraq's Anbar province. Members of the Al-Karableh, Albu Ubaid, Albu Mahal and Albu Salman tribes were brutally executed after paranoid ISIS militants accused them of collaborating with the Iraqi security forces. Iraqi Army soldiers and the Iran-backed volunteer Shiite militias allied with the Iraqi regime have had great success in pushing ISIS out of key towns and villages recently.

ISIS'\u00a0onslaught plunged Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from the country. The militants have also targeted Iraq's indigenous religious minorities, including Christians and followers of the ancient Yazidi faith, forcing tens of thousands from their homes. Since then, ISIS has carved out a self-styled caliphate in the large area straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border that it now controls. In early August, the United States launched airstrikes on the militant group in Iraq, in an effort to help Iraqi forces fight back against the growing threat by the IS militants, who still hold the northern Iraqi province of Ninevah and most of the western province of Anbar, in addition to small areas north of Baghdad in their hands, along with a large swath of land in neighboring Syria.

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do.

Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019", "answer": "Young women can get cheaper car insurance than men, economist warns .\nHe says drivers\u00a0with jobs mainly done by\u00a0women offered lower premiums .\nNewcastle University's Stephen McDonald analysed this pay-by-job system .\nDental nurse, 21, likely to pay 10 per cent less than they would have in 2011 .", "completion": ["Despite sex equality laws, young women can still get cheaper car insurance than young men as insurers offer lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, according to economist Stephen McDonald."]}

{"input": "The light in these extraordinary images has travelled so far that it has taken 4,200 years to get here. But, despite the distance, scientists say the photographs reveal, like no others before them, the immense forces unleashed when a star is born. The two images were taken 18 years apart, the first with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico in 1996 and the second by an international team of astronomers led by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) last year. Scroll down for video . Astronomers have used a telescope in New Mexico to watch a star take shape over eight years. This simulation shows how the outflow of material from the star has dramatically expanded as it takes shape. A simulated image from 1996 is on the left, and another from 2014 is on the right . The star \u2013 known as W75N(B)-VLA2 \u2013 is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun, although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust. But what has most excited astronomers is the change in shape of the violet area of super-hot electrified winds that are being ejected by the young star. The dramatic changes, in a cosmic blink of an eye relative to the age of the universe, is giving an unprecedented look at how young \u2018protostars\u2019 develop into fully-fledged stars. The pictures, created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the New Mexico desert in the U.S., show the electrified wind expanding away from the star until it is slowed by the black and yellow cloud of dust surrounding it. These images of the star were taken by the\ufffd\ufffdKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico. On the left is the star as seen in 1996, with its dust wrapped tightly around it, while by 2014 in the image on the right, this outflow has been pushed out into an elongated shape . This artist's illustration shows the development of W75N(B)-VLA-2. On the left, a hot wind from the young star expands nearly spherically, as seen in 1996. On the right right, as seen in 2014, the hot wind has been shaped by encountering a dusty, doughnut-shaped torus around the star and appears elongated . In the 1996 picture there is a relatively small region of space wind surrounding the star. But 18 years later that has expanded into a rugby-ball shape \u2013 because the dust has formed a doughnut shape around the star and offers less resistance to the space winds at its poles. Astronomer Carlos Carrasco-Gonzalez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said: \u2018The comparison is remarkable. \u2018We're seeing this dramatic change in real time, so this object is providing us an exciting opportunity to watch over the next few years as a very young star goes through the early stages of its formation.\u2019 The team will now continue to observe the star and see how it develops over the next few years. \u2018Our understanding of how massive young stars develop is much less complete than our understanding of how sun-like stars develop,\u2019 Dr Carrasco-Gonzalez said. \u2018It's going to be really great to be able to watch one as it changes. We expect to learn a lot from this object.' Take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe, compared to the number of stars, and you'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are. It's a problem that has perplexed scientists, but a study in early March claimed to have an answer, saying that the heat in star-forming clouds may be hindering stellar formation. They say that the temperatures are likely too hot to allow reasonable amounts of star formation, which leads to the lower number of stars we observe in the cosmos today. 'The amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times, so these clusters should be really star-rich,' said Dr Michael McDonald, a Hubble Fellow in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. 'You really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling, otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars.' The theory proposed by the researchers from MIT and Michigan State University suggests a number of reasons for why this is so. Researchers say that for some galaxy clusters the intracluster gas may simply be too hot - on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius. Even if one region experiences some cooling, the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further - an effect known as conduction.", "answer": "Astronomers have used a telescope in New Mexico to watch a star form .\nNamed W75N(B)-VLA2 it is 300 times brighter than the sun .\nImages from 1996 and 2014 show how it is beginning to take shape .\nIt could provide\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0insight into how huge stars are born .", "completion": ["Scientists have captured images of a star, W75N(B)-VLA2, being born 4,200 light years away, providing an unprecedented look at how young 'protostars' develop into fully-fledged stars."]}
{"input": "Starbucks is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little-known British company to avoid paying taxes across Europe. The U.S. coffee giant is being probed by the European Commission over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills. It could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal. For the first time yesterday, details emerged about the UK company at the heart of the probe, which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch government. Probe: Starbucks ran its European division - including the UK - through the Netherlands, but it paid just \u00a31.9million in tax to the Dutch government, from a reported \u00a3300million profit . Starbucks ran its European business, including its booming UK division, through the Netherlands where it paid almost no tax on its profits. But it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct British entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the Dutch taxman. By registering its Intellectual Property \u2013 such as its brand and logo \u2013 in a UK company called Alki LP, it was able to pay hefty sums from its Netherlands division into Britain. Its Dutch division paid just \u00a31.9million of tax, despite reporting profits of \u00a3300million \u2013 a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent. A Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the UK entity, including a claim that it had not a single registered employee. Starbucks has already been called \u2018immoral\u2019 by MPs for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the UK. Schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in Switzerland and selling them at a 20per cent mark-up to the Netherlands, where they are then roasted before being sold on again to Britain. This means that much of the money it makes from UK sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes. Revealed: It is now claimed the company, which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices, may have used a British company to put hefty sums from its Netherlands branch into the UK . Between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just \u00a38.6million in corporation tax in Britain, despite racking up combined sales of more than \u00a33billion here. But after its tactics were exposed, the company offered to pay a voluntary \u00a320million in tax to avoid a public boycott. Now details of a little-known tax division have emerged. A UK-registered holding business called Alki LP was set up to house the branding of the business. In a bizarre move, Alki appeared to have no employees \u2013 and was registered at the offices of Starbuck\u2019s tax lawyers Baker & McKenzie. Compliance: A Starbucks spokesman said the company complies 'with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines' But because of the very limited details available, it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received \u2013 or whether it paid any tax in the UK. Accounts for Starbucks\u2019 Dutch businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division. But without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the UK division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven. The business, which was closed down last year, has never filed proper accounts at Companies House. When it was dissolved, Alki was folded into a new company, Starbucks EMEA Holdings \u2013 though this business has also yet to file any accounts. This is an aspect that EU investigators believe is key to their probe. Earlier this year the British boss of Starbucks provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay \u2018normal\u2019 levels of tax for years. UK managing director Mark Fox said the company needed to get \u2018its mojo back\u2019 before it would begin to turn a profit. But he was confounded only weeks later when Starbucks reported its first ever UK profit of \u00a31.1million \u2013 despite sales being a bumper \u00a3300million. On this it paid taxes of just \u00a3232,363, as well as the sum of \u00a311.2million as part of its voluntary \u00a320million tax payment.

{"input": "Known for his life of fast cars, supermodels, and heavy-duty firearms, Dan Bilzerian is perhaps the last man you would expect to be fronting a video about responsible gun use. But the so-called 'King of Instagram' has been forced into making a public safety announcement in order to avoid jail after being arrested for placing homemade explosives into a tractor before shooting them. The film shows a stony-faced Bilzerian speaking from behind a desk in his lavish home, complete with gun-shaped candle holder, an action figurine of himself, and a bizarre painting, while lecturing people on 'responsible' gun ownership. Dead pan: Speaking from a desk in his home, complete with gun candle holder (rear left), an action model of himself (front left), Dan Bilzerian has been forced into making this film about responsible gun ownership . Not amused: The playboy gun-obsessive was forced into making the short film in order to avoid jail after being accused of placing homemade explosives in a tractor and shooting them . He says: 'As an avid shooter remember to shoot responsibly and follow the rules. 'Public lands are for everyone's use. Be responsible when shooting and clean up the area you were shooting in so others can enjoy the land.' Referencing the charges against him, Bilzerian says: 'When shooting exploding rifle targets check with local and state law laws. 'Just because you can buy an exploding target, does not mean that it is legal to mix and explode. 'If shooting exploding targets use only in intended use containers.' The tape then cuts away to footage, believed to be of Bilzerian, shooting a target which promptly explodes into a plume of flame. He adds: 'As this is not intend use.' Bilzerian published this photo after he was released from custody following his arrest last year with the caption 'jail... let's not do that again', a phrase he is forced to repeat in the film . Arsenal: Trust-fund child and professional gambler Bilzerian amassed 7.4million Instagram followers by posting a constant stream of images featuring guns, young women, and wild parties . Bilzerian goes on to warn viewers that they can kill themselves or others when shooting exploding targets, before urging people to 'be responsible'. He then ends the film by saying 'jail... let's not do that again', the same phrase he sent to his followers after he was initially released from custody, along with a picture of himself on his private jet with two young women. Bilzerian has a following of 7million people on Instagram where he has become known for posting images of scantily clad women, wild parties, and his extension gun collection. His outlandish lifestyle has led to legions of fans and critics following his every move, which is all funded by his vast inherited wealth. And it was that following the Bureau of Land Management decided to tap into when they agreed not to jail Bilzerian following his arrest last year. Instead of locking him away, they gave him a rather nominal $10,000 fine, but also strong-armed him into making the film, which has since been widely viewed. Lethal force: Bilzerian once served in the Navy and took part in SEAL training, but was dismissed two days before passing after being disrespectful to an officer . Heavy artillery: Bilzerain has used his socail media following to turn himself into a celebrity by bragging about his lifestyle, including firing this 20mm cannon . Explosive temperament: On Thanksgiving Day, Blizerian shared this video of him blowing targets to smithereens with a large-caliber gun . This is not the first time Bilzerian's crazy antics have got him into trouble with the law. At the end of last year he found himself on the end of a lawsuit after model Vanessa Castano claimed he kicked her in the face in a nightclub. Footage from the scene appears to show Bilzerian dancing on a stage in a club in South Beach, Miami, with the crowd below him, before he lashes out with his foot. However, last month police said they were no longer investigating the model's claims. Bilzerian has been in trouble with the law before after  pornstar\u00a0Janice Griffith, 19, attempted to sue him for $85,000 when he threw her off his roof and into a pool, breaking her foot . Model Vanessa Castano (pictured) also threatened to take Bilzerian to court after alleging than he kicked her in the face while dancing in a club in South Beach, Miami . He was also facing a lawsuit for $85,000 in lost earnings after he threw pornstar Janice Griffith, 19, off the roof of his home and into the pool below. However she landed short, breaking her foot. She had tried to claim money for shoots she could not attend following the accident. Bilzerian fought back, claiming the model grabbed at his t-shirt at the last second, nearly dragging him off the roof with her. The charges were eventually dropped. Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida. Bilzerian's life usually consists of partying with young, attractive women and firing high-calibre weapons - so it is no surprise he was less than enthused about the safety video . Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler . He has won multiple tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.

Two weeks ago the Prime Minister let the BBC film him preparing lunch at his home in his Oxfordshire constituency. Then this weekend it was the No 10 kitchen that was the focus of attention as he made a pitch for the family vote by being pictured at breakfast with wife Samantha and their three children. Scroll down for video . Breakfast time: David and Samantha Cameron talk to their nine-year-old son Elwen in tonight\u2019s ITV film . Making a point: Mr Cameron chats with his children over the No 10 breakfast table during the ITV show . And tonight you can see the Downing Street kitchen all over again as they once more gather round the breakfast table (white marble and costing \u00a3750), this time for the cameras of ITV News. When he invited the BBC film crew into his constituency kitchen, Mr Cameron blundered into a row after admitting he did not want a third term as Prime Minister. This time round, he may have thought he was on safer ground being questioned by his own family over the No 10 breakfast table. But the chat showed them teasing the Prime Minister after he appeared to confuse the Disney film Frozen for a book. He asked his four-year-old daughter Florence about her fairy costume for World Book Day, adding: \u2018Why are you not going as Elsa [from Frozen]? That\u2019s what I want to know.\u2019 His wife Samantha answered, saying: \u2018Because it\u2019s not a book.\u2019 The PM laughed awkwardly before attempting to change the subject, asking: \u2018Anyway, have you got some interesting views on school food?\u2019 One of his older children replied bluntly: \u2018It\u2019s absolutely disgusting.

{"input": "It was heralded as the world\u2019s oldest musical instrument; a bone with two holes in it seemingly made by Neanderthals to serenade their companions. But now a study says it\u2019s not an instrument at all - but rather, simply a bone chewed by hyenas and left in a cave. The research suggests historians have been fooled by these phoney objects - and, in fact, all such \u2018instruments\u2019 attributed to Neanderthals are simply chew toys of animals. A researcher says a 'bone flute' found in Slovenia is not an instrument - instead, he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks. The bone is shown here, believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in Europe, on show in Ljubljana. The bone was discovered on 18 July 1995 in Slovenia . The latest analysis was conducted by Dr Cajus Diedrich from the Paleo-Logic Independent Institute of Geosciences. In a paper published in the Royal Society of Open Science, he took a look at several \u2018musical instruments\u2019 that had been attributed to Neanderthals. Neanderthals may have created and worn the world's first jewellery 130,000 years ago, according to scientists. Researchers examining eight talons taken from a white-tailed eagle found at Krapina in Croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet. The claws bear multiple cut marks, notches and signs that they had been polishing by the Neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found. Anthropologists at the University Kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in Europe. The findings add to evidence that Neanderthals were not the slow-witted and primitive creatures they are often portrayed as. One in particular, the Divje Babe Flute, is often said to be the world\u2019s oldest musical instrument. The cave bear femur, pierced with two holes, was found in 1995 at the Divje Babe Archaeological park near Cerkno in northwestern Slovenia. Dr Diedrich said analysis of the bone shows the holes are teeth marks, and the shape is just the result of the bone not breaking when it was chewed. In most caves, carnivore damage like this can be seen in about 20 per cent of animal remains and 80 per cent of bear cub remains. But while adult remains were often \u2018crushed to pieces\u2019, bear cubs often had certain patterns like this. \u2018These are not instruments, nor human made, but products of the most important cave bear scavengers of Europe, hyenas,\u2019 Dr Diedrich wrote. \u2018Hyenas left bones in repeating similar tooth mark and crush damage stages, demonstrating a butchering/bone cracking strategy. \u2018Hyenas produced round-oval puncture marks in cub femora only by the bone-crushing premolar teeth of both upper and lower jaw.\u2019 One instrument in particular, the Divje Babe Flute, is often said to be the world\u2019s oldest musical instrument. The cave bear femur, pierced with two holes, was found in 1995 at the Divje Babe Archaeological park (shown) near Cerkno in northwestern Slovenia . The latest analysis says that many bones found in caves can simply be attributed to animals around 30,000 years ago, rather than Neanderthals. Shown is an exhibit of the life of a Neanderthal family in a cave in the Neanderthal Museum in the northern town of Krapina in Croatia . The first \u2018Neanderthal flutes\u2019 were discovered in Slovenia in the 1920s and, since then, many others have been identified. Sadly for those who thought Neanderthals might have played music in this way to one another, though, it seems the earlier analysis may have been wrong. Shown is the 'Divje Babe flute' bear bone, believed to be the oldest musical instrument discovered in Europe, in the National Museum in Ljubljana . Dr Diedrich derides all the research that has gone into these bones so far. He also points out that there is no evidence on the bones that tools have been used to make the holes, further cementing the idea they were made by hyena teeth. What\u2019s more, he also said that most of the \u2018bone flutes\u2019 do not actually date from Neanderthal times - 200,000 to 30,000 years ago. Rather, he says they can more closely be attributed to the Aurignacian culture 38,000 to 29,000 years ago - sometimes said to be the first modern humans in Europe, owing to their grasp of using tools. \u2018The \u201ccave bear cub femora with holes\u201d are, in all cases, neither instruments nor human made at all,\u2019 he concludes. \u2018All cave bear pseudo-bone flutes are not dated to Neanderthal Middle Palaeolithic Mousterian layers, but instead, if possible to date, to Late Palaeolithic, Aurignacian/Gravettian layers.\u2019 He added: \u2018Hyenas left, therefore, \u201cpseudo-bone flutes\u201d during the Late Middle to Late Pleistocene all over Europe in cave bear dens, and on different cave bear species/subspecies. \u2018This is known due to lack of breakage on most of the cave bear cub femora, which generally show additional diagonal zigzag margins (from chewing joints by scissor teeth of hyenas) or have triangular or smaller scratch tooth marks.\u2019", "answer": "Researcher says a 'bone flute' found in Slovenia is not an instrument .\nInstead he says it is simply a bone chewed by a hyena with teeth marks .\nHe\u00a0claims all such instruments were made by hyenas, not Neanderthals .\nAnd the bones do not even originate from Neanderthal times .", "completion": ["A study suggests that what was believed to be the world's oldest musical instrument, a bone with two holes, attributed to Neanderthals, is actually a bone chewed by hyenas, challenging the idea that Neanderthals created musical instruments."]}

{"input": "Lady Penelope (left) and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker (right) have been given slight tweaks for the 2015 remake of Thunderbirds . FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO. ONE. Thunderbirds are Go! Again! Yes, 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world, ITV is bringing it back. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by computer-generated figures. In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added. Geeky scientist Brains has lost his bow tie for an open-neck shirt and has been given an Indian accent. Even Lady Penelope and her faithful chauffeur Aloysius Parker have been given slight tweaks for 2015. Lady Penelope is this time voiced by Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike. She has also lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent. Parker, meanwhile, returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform and sports a roll-neck sweater. His new look is completed by swept-back, grey-streaked hair. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 50-minute episodes over two series, shown in 66 countries. The show spawned a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products, from puppets and lunchboxes to T-shirts, so much so that December 1966 was dubbed Thunderbirds Christmas. This is not, however the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was an unmitigated disaster, losing almost \u00a320 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show\u2019s co-creator, called it \u2018the biggest load of c**p\u2019 he had seen and rejected an offer of \u00a3400,000 for just going to the premiere. \u2018Remaking something as iconic as Thunderbirds means that your feelings of excitement are mixed with apprehension because you don\u2019t want to do anything to tarnish it,\u2019 says Giles Ridge, the show\u2019s executive producer. \u2018We didn\u2019t want to mess too much with Thunderbirds but needed to make it in a way that would excite 21st-century children.\u2019 In a nod to 21st-century political correctness, there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added . As with the original, at the heart of Thunderbirds are the five gung-ho Tracy brothers, all named after real astronauts on America\u2019s Mercury space mission in the early 1960s: Scott (Carpenter), John (Glenn), Virgil (Grissom), Gordon (Cooper) and Alan (Shephard). Their mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. Inspired by their widower billionaire father Jeff, (a stalwart of the original series but missing in this) they live on Tracy Island in the middle of the South Pacific in 2065. Lady Penelope (pictured as a puppet) has lost the twin-set and pearls and looks a much more modern, dressed down lady secret agent in the new remake . When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There are also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Main writer Rob Hoegee is in Los Angeles but watches script readings on Skype. Peter Jackson\u2019s animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Despite all the new technology, the backgrounds are models, including an 18ft-high Tracy Island. Gerry Anderson and his wife Sylvia came up with Thunderbirds after a mining disaster in West Germany in 1963. On the original show everyone had to multi-task; for Sylvia that meant voicing Lady Penelope, International Rescue\u2019s London agent. Rosamund Pike says she didn\u2019t hesitate when she was offered the role. \u2018As soon as ITV asked me,\u2019 she says, \u2018I knew it would be very exciting. \u2018Lady Penelope often plays up to the frivolous elements of who she is \u2014 a girl who loves clothes, pink cars, little dogs \u2014 to blindside people and conceal what she really is up to at any given point That is usually breaking in somewhere she shouldn\u2019t be, finding secrets in dangerous situations.\u2019 Her car is no longer a Rolls (no brands are used in children\u2019s television programmes now), but thankfully she still has Parker. \u2018The producers met me for coffee,\u2019 says David Graham. \u2018I think they wanted to see what sort of shape I\u2019m in, but I was thrilled to be able to recreate this character. Parker was originally just a minor character, but he eventually became Gerry\u2019s favourite.\u2019 Parker returns with his original voice, that of 89-year-old David Graham, but has dropped his chauffeur uniform (pictured) and now sports a roll-neck sweater with swept-back, grey-streaked hair . Parker has retained his distinctive cockney-trying-to-be-snooty accent. David says: \u2018Gerry took me to lunch and said: \u201cI want you to listen to the wine waiter.\u201d So the waiter came over and asked if we would like to see the wine list and he just had this great accent. I\u2019m not sure he knew we modelled the voice on him.\u2019 There has been a concerted effort to increase the female and multicultural roles in the show to make it appeal to aspirational girls and boys of all races. Merlin actress Angel Coulby plays Kayo, an \u2018adopted little sister\u2019 to the Tracy brothers who is in charge of security for Tracy Island. Former Casualty actress Adjoa Andoh voices Colonel Casey, commanding officer of the Global Defence Force. Thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002.

Brisbane was also predicted to miss out due to bad weather, but the moon was pictured revealing itself through rain clouds towards the end of a total lunar eclipse . The beginning of the eclipse was captured from behind leaves illuminated by a street light in Canberra on Saturday . 'It's highly likely that it will still be cloudy,' The Bureau of Meteorology's Chris Webb had said of Sydney, adding that a break in the clouds at precisely the right moment could still present a slim chance for hopeful sky gazers. Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart residents were also promised slim chance of viewing the phenomenon due to poor weather conditions, but clear night skies were predicted for Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. Those faced with bad weather may not have missed out on much however, with the event being one of the shortest lunar eclipses of the century. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the\u00a0ABC\u00a0earlier.

This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse. There was no rain in Melbourne, where an uninterrupted view of the lunar event began at 9:15pm and peaked at 11pm. Less positive wass the forecast for Hobart, which was for clouds and a 20 per cent chance of rain. The same was also expected in Canberra and a late storm was due in Darwin, however the former managed to clear up enough for some to see the lunar show.

A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on\u00a0the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking\u00a0after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you\u00a0took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to\u00a0some extent to pay for his care home fees.

The Kennel Club says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers \u2013 and is urging owners to be alert to the threat. Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the Veterinary Poisons Information Service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick: Around 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014 . Unlike Crufts prizewinner Jagger the Irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well-meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate \u2013 which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life-threatening anaemia. Nick Sutton, a Kennel Club poisons expert, said: \u2018There are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products \u2013 particularly foods eaten by humans \u2013 are fine for a dog to eat. \u2018Many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much-loved pets.\u2019 The popularity of e-cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases, with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine-rich refills \u2013 an increase of 300 per cent. However, many more cases are suspected to have occurred, because not all poisonings are reported. Chewing gum was another major cause of poisoning. Just one pack of gum can prove deadly, causing dangerous drops in blood sugar and liver failure. If you fear your dog has been poisoned, the Kennel Club urges owners to contact their vet immediately, even if their dog appears well, as it can take several days before symptoms appear. Mr Sutton said: \u2018Dogs are very intelligent, very curious and have a great sense of smell. \u2018But we have to be careful about feeding them things that aren\u2019t intended for them.\u2019", "answer": "About 56,000 dogs treated by vets for poisoning between 2010 and 2014 .\nMost had simply found a piece of food lying around  or been fed a treat .\nPainkillers  the most common cause, followed by rat and mouse bait .\nKennel Club poisons expert warns\u00a0even 'harmless' foods can be dangerous .", "completion": ["Over 10,000 dogs are poisoned annually by consuming everyday items like paracetamol and chocolate, warns the Kennel Club, urging pet owners to be aware of the risks these substances pose to their pets."]}
{"input": "Google is facing a fine of up to \u00a34billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant. The EU has been investigating the US search engine for five years following complaints that it abuses its dominance in the continent - but proceedings have stalled on three previous occasions. Now the European\u00a0Commission, the EU's top antitrust authority,\u00a0is asking companies who previously filed confidential complaints against Google for permission to publish them, so that officials can begin to build a case against the firm. If found to have been behaving unfairly, Google could be fined ten per cent of its annual revenues, which would be more than \u00a34 billion based on last year's performance. Facing huge fine:\u00a0Google is facing a fine of up to \u00a34billion as Europe prepares to file a high-profile anti-competition lawsuit against the internet giant . Shopping, comparison and travel companies are among those that have been contacted by the EU, The Wall Street Journal reports. US companies Microsoft and Trip Advisor are among those that have filed complaints against Google with the EU. A decision to file charges would kick start the EU's most prominent antitrust suit since its ten year-long campaign against Microsoft Corp. - the firm was forced to pay out more than a \u00a31billion in fines in 2012. The specific document the EU is said to be preparing is referred to as a Statement of Objections. Once filed, it's likely that a number of deeper investigations, counter-statements, and settlement discussions would ensue. If the search engine and the EU cannot come to an agreement, then fines could be issued and restrictions placed on Google's behavior. Leading investigation: New EU antitrust chief\u00a0Margrethe Vestager has suggested she favours pursuing legal action against Google over pushing for a settlement . The company would then have the right to appeal the case to the highest European court. Even if it is settled without a huge fine, antitrust cases can be hugely disruptive for firm, as Microsoft discovered. The European Commission has also been investigating whether Google has been 'scraping' content from rivals' sites, and placing unreasonable restrictions on advertisers and software developers who do business with them. A 'preliminary view' taken by the commission in March  2013 was that Google was abusing its dominant position in a number of areas . The company has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking in Berlin last week, Kent Walker, the company's Senior Vice President & General Counsel, highlighted the 'painfully long list of unsuccessful Google products', including Google+ and Street View in Germany, as proof that competition laws were serving their purpose. Long-running dispute: Former EU antitrust chief\u00a0Joaquin Almunia, above, made three unsuccessful attempts to resolve the dispute between Google and its European rivals . The EU's investigation of complaints that Google abuses its dominance of the online search market to hurt rivals began in 2010. The US company handles more than 90 per cent of Web searches in Europe - considerably higher than its share of the US market. Comparison-shopping sites claim that when consumers use Google to search for products online, Google positions results from Google Shopping prominently. The argument is that this\u00a0relegates products from rival sites to positions lower down the search page, where they might not be seen. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's new antitrust chief, has  suggested she will pursue legal action rather than seek a settlement. Google and Commissioner Vestager\u2019s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute, but in each case intense pressure by national governments, Internet rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. The latest settlement proposed by Mr. Almunia fell apart following a series of interventions by powerful political players, including a letter from the economy ministers of France and Germany calling for greater concessions from Google, and protests from German publishing houses. In November the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for a possible breakup of Google, brushing aside an unusual series of objections from the US Congress that the move risked politicizing an antitrust investigation. Ms. Vestager met a month ago with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. Last week, she indicated that her priority was to ensure that smaller Internet firms could compete with the industry's giants.", "answer": "EU has been investigating the US search giant's practises for five years .\n3 previous attempts to settle matter have stalled due to political pressure .\nOne complaint is that Google Search leads users on to the firm's own sites .\nCurrent case could result in Google being fined 10% of its annual revenues .", "completion": ["Google could face a fine of up to \u00a34 billion as the EU prepares to file an anti-competition lawsuit against the company, following a five-year investigation into complaints that it abuses its dominance in Europe."]}

Lets disco:\u00a0Michelle Obama strutted her stuff on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, in a follow-up routine to one they first did in 2013 . OMG: Called\u00a0The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair  pulled some embarrassing 'mom moves' Join in:\u00a0First Lady Michelle Obama and Jimmy Fallon took it to the dance floor again during her appearance on The Tonight Show on Thursday night . Oh no you didn't: At the end of the routine, Fallon pulled a goofy move he called the 'Barack Obama' Take this: But Michelle came back kicking, showing off an equally-awful jive called the 'Jimmy Fallon' In dancing up a storm, the two demonstrated some jives they called 'You Go Girl' and 'Oh My God, I Didn't Know You Were Coming Here!' But when Fallon pulled a silly move he called the 'Barack Obama', Michelle obviously hit back with a terrible take on Fallon himself. The Let's Move! Initiative encourages people to eat better, be more active and healthier. It was first launched in February 2010. During a sit-down with Fallon, Michelle spoke of what she's achieved in the last five years, and her love of music. 'I have an iPod,' she said. 'I usually just put my earphones in in the car. I\u2019m always listening to music. That\u2019s the way I kind of settle myself.' Initiative: Lets Move! is an anti-childhood obesity campaign that Michelle first launched in 2010 . However music isn't something she necessarily shares with her daughters,  Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14. 'Now I\u2019m at the stage where my kids are introducing me to music and they\u2019re like, ''You don\u2019t wanna hear this mom - the language is too bad'',' she said. 'Well, what are you doing listening to it?' On March 16, Michelle busted some similar moves with Ellen DeGeneres, dancing in a much more choreographed segment to Uptown Funk.

The US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to the same song on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year. In addition to breaking it down on stage, Michelle Obama told Fallon how she gets her teenagers to eat healthy food. Obama said she has a 'no treat' \u00a0rule in her house if her daughters Sasha and Malia don't eat their vegetables. If the girls tell her their 'full' because they don't want \u00a0to eat the vegetables in front of them, there are no substitute meals if they become hungry later. 'After a couple of days of starvation, it\u2019s like, \u2018gimme the broccoli,\u2019 she joked . Fallon told FLOTUS that he too has a method of getting child to eat healthy but his method is a lot sneakier than hers. 'I\u2019m trying to sneak vegetables into anything, but there is a sneaky way to do it,' Fallon said of giving his two young daughters vegetables. 'I hide it in brownies,' he said.

{"input": "The moon is set to turn a sinister-looking blood red this Easter weekend. The total lunar eclipse will transform the moon on Saturday night and will be visible in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. According to one US pastor, the event was predicted in the Bible and hints at an imminent world-changing event, but Nasa is quick to point out that the change in hue is entirely harmless. Scroll down for video . Saturday\u2019s total lunar eclipse, which will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange, will be visible in in the skies of North America, Asia and Australia. A previous total lunar eclipse as seen from Mexico city on December 21, 2010 is pictured . The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Pastor John Hagee told The Mirror that the sight suggests a world-changing event will take place, as predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: \u2018The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes.\u2019 Mr Hagee, who has written a book on the Tetrad called \u2018Four Blood Moons\u2019, said that because the Blood Moon falls on Easter Weekend, it\u2019s a sign that 'something dramatic will happen which will change the whole world'. The event is called a Tetrad since it involves four successive total blood red lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons. \u2018I believe we're going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world,' he said. The strange celestial sight, which will be visible in the US, was predicted in the Bible and could hint at a world-changing event, such as the return of Christ, according to one pastor. This image shows the red moon over a church in LA during the last blood moon in October last year . A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its \u2018blood red\u2019 appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. There are numerous mentions of blood moons in the Bible, such as in the Book of Joel, chapter two, which says the 'Day of the Lord will be as when the sun refuses to shine' and in Luke, which hints that signs in the sun, moon and stars will tell of the second coming. While the Bible prophesises blood moons, it does not give a timeline of when the significant event will happen. Mr Hagee said: \u2018It just says \u201cwhen you see these signs\u201d - and four blood moons is a very significant one - '\u201dthe end of this age is coming.\u201d\u2019 While the event may be of huge religious significance to some people, for others it will simply be a chance to see something beautiful light up the night sky. The lunar eclipse will occur when the moon passes behind the Earth, into its shadow. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. This gives rise to its \u2018blood red\u2019 appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. When the moon first enters the Earth's partial shadow, know as the penumbra, a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon. This gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. At the eclipse's peak, the moon enters the Earth's full shadow; the umbra. At this stage, the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sun's red visible light; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset. As a result, the red light reflects off the moon's surface, casting a reddish rust hue over it . Blood moons \u00a0- an image from the last event is shown- \u00a0are predicted in the Bible. According to the King James Bible: \u2018The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes\u2019 Two of the four blood moons have already occured. The first happened on April 15, 2014 and the second on October 8, 2014. The third blood moon will begin on Saturday April 4, 2015 . The last will happen on September 28, 2015 . \u2018During the eclipse, the moon often looks reddish because sunlight has passed through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out most of its blue light,\u2019 Nasa said. \u2018This eerie, harmless effect has earned the tongue-in-cheek nickname \u201cblood moon\u201d\u2019 The \u2018Tetrad\u2019 of four alignments within two years, happens just a few times in every 2,000 years. Sky watchers will have to be quick to catch this installment because Nasa predicts the total eclipse will last for just five minutes in the US. The partial phases will be visible on April 4 just before the sun rises in the US, Space.com reported. People living on the West Coast of America will see the moon turn red from 7.58am (11.58 GMT), while sky watchers in Australia, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia will see the total phases for up 12 minutes, from 7.54am EDT.

In this image the last blood moon is situated high above Sydney . The 'Tetrad,' cycle began in April last year. It involves a series of four dark red 'blood moons.' At the end of the cycle in September 2015, some believe the end of the world will happen . The final blood moon of the Tetrad will occur on September 28 and there will be nine sets of them in the 21st century. But Nasa has previously said that the Tetrad only happened three times in the past 500 years. From 1600 to 1900, for example, there were none at all. According to Mr Hagee, each time the Tetrad has happened during that time, there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it. In 1493, the first Tetrad saw the expulsion of Jews by the Catholic Spanish Inquisition. The second happened in 1949, right after the State of Israel was founded. And the most recent one, in 1967, happened during the Six-Day War between Arabs and Israelis. Mr Hagee said that the first of the Tetrad blood moons happened on April 15, right in the middle of the Jewish holiday of Passover. The second, on October 8, occured during the Feast of the Tabernacle. The third, this Saturday is also occurring during Passover and on Easter weekend. The final one happens on September 28, 2015, during the Feast of the Tabernacles.

The Czech Republic star could not contend with Murray's selection of shot making in Florida . It will be Murray\u2019s first Masters level final since he won the title in what is his home from home two years ago. That fact backs up the belief that he is returning to the kind of form last seen from him in the first half of 2013, which led to him winning the Wimbledon title. Since then there has been back surgery, a new coach in Amelie Mauresmo and a revamped support team and all manner of setbacks. But a Grand Slam final, making the last four of Indian Wells and now the final here tells the story of his improvement this season. Occasionally there have been periods of wandering concentration in the past week but his mind was very focussed. It may have helped that ex assistant coach Dani Vallverdu was sitting in Berdych\u2019s corner accompanied by ex-fitness coach Jez Green, who is now also working with the Czech. But there was none of the highly-charged atmosphere of that night in Melbourne. Kim Sears, who he is marrying next week, kept a much lower profile this time, hidden beneath the wide-peaked straw hat protecting her from the fierce Florida sun. The 27-year-old was in clinical form as he set up a final showdown with Novak Djokovic . There is no love lost between Murray and Berdych, especially after this year's Australian Open semi-final . Murray was annoyed after Berdych asked for one of the balls to be taken out of play during the first set . Both players thought it necessary to question the umpire as events unfolded in the first set . Berdych questions the chair umpire following an overruled call at the Masters 1000 evnt . Murray and his close friend Vallverdu have now regained the equilibrium in their relationship, but the Scot admitted afterwards that there are still extraneous factors with him playing Berdych, who he does not especially like. \u201cIt was different from then (Melbourne) for sure, but it was still not easy even if it appears that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit tricky and not a comfortable situation. I\u2019m quite pleased with the way I have handled the emotions in both these matches.\u201d Murray has played more matches on this Crandon Park court than any other outside Wimbledon\u2019s Centre Court and the Rod Laver Arena, and knows what to expect in conditions that are usually heavy and humid with a brisk breeze. Murray's fiancee Kim Sears was back in the stands wearing the same wide brimmed hat . Berdych's model fiancee Ester Satorova cools down with some water as she watches her beau . Murray's former coach Dani Valverdu (left) and trainer Jez Green (right) switched camps to join Berdych . \u201cWhen the conditions are like that, Tomas can still generate a lot of power. But when I've played him on some of the quicker surfaces, I feel like I've been able to hit through the court and make him move a lot. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long five or six weeks for me so I wanted to try and conserve as much energy as I can. I obviously have some days off next week to relax.\u201d Murray had a fairly clear game plan, taking some speed off his first serve to increase its percentage and not allow Berdych too many looks at his more vulnerable second delivery. He also sought to exploit the 6\u2019 5\u201d Czech\u2019s slightly cumbersome movement and prevent him from hitting too many of the bazooka forehands that had helped the Czech forge a 6-5 record in their previous encounters. Murray stretches to make a return as he battles to win a place in Sunday's final . Murray cannot hide his delight as he throws his sweatbands into the crowd after the game . Murray, now sure to overtake Rafael Nadal in the rankings to close on Roger Federer at two, took advantage of two wobbly Berdych service games at the start of each set, but was then unable to hold his serve before breaking again. The only whiff of controversy came after four games of the match when Berdych, whose whingeing makes Murray appear positively laidback, complained about the state of the balls. It did not impress his opponent. At this time of year it might be appropriate to describe him as Doubting Tomas and Murray was in such purposeful mood, and serving so consistently, that he comfortably held onto his lead in both sets.", "answer": "British No 1 defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-4 to reach Miami Open final .\nThere's no love lost between the pair after controversy at Australian Open .\nDani Valverdu and Jez Green switched from Murray's team to the Czech's .\nBrit will play Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday .", "completion": ["Andy Murray defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 in the Miami Open semi-final, setting up a final showdown with Novak Djokovic."]}

{"input": "A wife has told how she has put her husband on a lifelong sex ban and tracks his every move, after discovering he had cheated on her after taking a lie detector test. Despite his infidelity, Haley and Kev Mulholland still share a house in Bristol, though Mr Mulholland has to sleep on the living room sofa. The mother-of-eight says that while she does not want her husband, she does not want any other woman to have him either. Haley Mulholland became suspicious husband Kevin was having an affair after reading his Facebook page . Mrs Mulholland monitors her husband\u2019s movements, checks his phone and even sniffs him to see if she can smell another woman\u2019s perfume. 'I might not want Kev, but I don\u2019t want anyone else to have him either,' said the 45 year old, who is mum to Sophie, 27, Kerrie, 25, Kasey, 14, Brittany, 13, Paige ten, Tyler, nine, Madison, eight and five-year-old Alexius. 'I keep tabs on his phone and on his Facebook page. He swears he\u2019s staying true, but I couldn\u2019t trust him as far as I could throw him. Over the past few months I\u2019ve become quite the detective.' Though Mrs Mulholland has so far found no evidence to suggest he is straying, she refuses to take her husband of 15 years back. She said: 'While we\u2019re not divorced, we\u2019re not together. There\u2019s no kissing, sex or anything like that, though Kev\u2019s tried his luck. 'He creeps into my room saying the sofa\u2019s given him a bad back and that he needs to sleep in my bed. I just tell him where to go. Kevin and Haley, who have been together for 15 years, are pictured on their wedding day . 'The other night he started stroking my thigh. I slapped his hand away. This body is well and truly out of bounds.' The Mulhollands' marriage became rocky shortly before they renewed their wedding vows on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2013. Mrs Mulholland said: 'A month before the big day I was on the computer and noticed Facebook was still logged on to Kev\u2019s profile. 'I clicked on his inbox, and discovered a message from one of our neighbours. 'She\u2019d written \"Have you told her yet?\" which made my heart race. 'Had my Kev been going round for more than a cup of sugar? 'The rest of their correspondence was harmless enough, so I decided to give Kev the benefit of the doubt. Haley learns that Kevin did cheat her on after a lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle televsion show . 'But just weeks after our wedding I started hearing rumours about the two of them. 'I asked Kev if something was going on and he denied it. But I smelt a rat - a love rat.' That is when Mrs Mulholland started to doubt her husband and put him on a sex ban until he admitted the truth. She said: 'I trusted the people who were telling me. So I told him, no nookie until I get to the bottom it. 'Two years went by and I stuck to my word. We slept on opposite sides of the bed, absolutely no touching. Haley says she has banished Kevin to the sofa after learning that he cheated and has also imposed a sex ban . 'By the end Kev was so desperate for some hanky panky he suggested we went on the Jeremy Kyle show for a lie detector test. 'I booked for us to go on the show. A couple of nights later I checked Kev\u2019s Facebook inbox and felt sick to my stomach. 'There were loads of messages from this other woman. She had written that she was worried she\u2019d caught an STI from Kev. It was absolutely disgusting.' Mrs Mulholland went round to confront her neighbour who claimed her Facebook had been hacked. But the lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show revealed that Mr Mulholland had cheated on his wife with their neighbour.

The couple kiss after renewing their wedding vows before friends and family . She said: 'Kev walked off stage, swearing that the results were fixed. But that evening he finally admitted the truth. 'He said it had only lasted five minutes, but that didn\u2019t matter to me. Once a cheat always a cheat. 'I knew we were over but I didn\u2019t kick him out for the sake of the kids, instead I moved him downstairs. 'The little ones are none the wiser.' Mrs Mulholland said she has now started to track her husband\u2019s movements to make sure he isn\u2019t seeing other women. 'It sounds crazy as, hand on my heart, I do not want him back. But whenever he goes out I make a note of how long for and calculate what he could be doing,' she said. In happier times: Haley and Kevin who is father to six of her eight children . 'Maybe it\u2019s jealousy or perhaps it\u2019s because I want him to suffer. 'I know his Facebook password and I log in most days to check whether his floozy has been in touch. 'She\u2019s kept quiet, and if she has any sense she\u2019ll continue to do so.' It\u2019s not just technology Mrs Mulholland uses to try and catch her husband out. 'The other day I hugged him as soon as he walked through the door. I think he saw it as progress, but I was just seeing if I could smell another woman on him.

{"input": "Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video . Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa . They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases. However, Neandethals may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred. Dr Simon Underdown, a principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University and co-author of the study, said: 'As Neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease. 'When Homo sapiens came out of Africa they brought diseases with them. 'We know that Neanderthals were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them. 'Perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but Neanderthals could not.' The findings add to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought. Recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen, Neanderthals had sophisticated culture, were master tool makers and may even have had their own language. The new study suggests that Neanderthals also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience. Indeed, there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs. Dr Underdown and his colleague Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a researcher in infectious diseases at Cambridge University and University College London, analysed recent genetic studies on Neanderthals and other early humans. They also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence. Infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis, shown above, may have been common in Neanderthals . Most evidence from the fossil record suggest that Neanderthals tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle, but there are also signs of inflammation and infection. Their study, which is published on the open source database bioRxiv, contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the Holocene about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock. Instead, they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when Neanderthals dominated much of Europe and Asia between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago, when they disappeared. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies . They say pathogens like TB, typhoid and Crimean fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago. Genetic sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan - another early human ancestor - DNA has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species. These include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick-borne encephalitis. Dr Underdown said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern Europe that Neanderthals inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage. Other genes found in modern Papua New Guineans that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from Neanderthals. The fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like the skull above, are revealing more details about their lifestyles . Analysis of ancient DNA has also shown that Neanderthals carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning, or sepsis. Dr Underdown said: 'There are genetic signals in the Neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them. 'It had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements. 'Be here we have got Neanderthals being infected by these diseases long before those developments.'", "answer": "Anthropologists claim that Neanderthals suffered many modern diseases .\nDNA analysis has shown that they had immunity against common illnesses .\nBut they believe modern humans brought new infectious pathogens such as Heliocbacter pylori with them out of Africa and infected Neanderthals .\nThis suggests infectious diseases are much older than previously thought .", "completion": ["New research suggests that infectious diseases carried by modern humans migrating out of Africa may have led to the extinction of Neanderthals, with evidence suggesting our prehistoric cousins were infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold."]}
{"input": "Who can resist Boden\u2019s bright knits and floral prints? I most certainly can\u2019t writes Clare Goldwin. Well, not when it comes to my seven-year-old, Ella, anyway. For years, I\u2019ve happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from Mini Boden. But when it comes to buying clothes from Boden for myself, I\u2019ve always steered clear. Their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and \u2018mumsy\u2019 jersey dresses, not to mention \u2018jaunty\u2019 prints in eye-catching colours, have always been a big no-no for me. Clare Goldwin (pictured) admits that she will sometimes fork out for Boden's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she doesn't want to be labelled a Boden 'yummy mummy' Who wants to be labelled a Boden \u2018yummy mummy\u2019 at 50 paces, and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school-run? For many years, Boden \u2014 which launched in 1991 \u2014 made a success of its appeal to the \u2018Sloane\u2019 market. But recently, the company has experienced more challenging times. Profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and, while they rose again in 2012, they remained flat for 2013. Now, however, Boden seems to have finally cracked it, and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections. Glossy magazines have praised their spring/summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands. And they\u2019ve even seduced the notoriously difficult U.S. market, where sales are soaring. Experts are putting the success down to the use of luxury fabrics, with more cashmere and silk mixes, plus more limited-edition pieces \u2014 so there\u2019s less chance of bumping into someone wearing the same outfit. They\u2019re also attracting customers by toning down their colour palette, so the look is not so \u2018sweet shop\u2019, and making many of the prints more sophisticated and subtle. So, can this latest collection keep its core, middle-class customers happy, while appealing to the more fashionable woman? With the mid-season sale now on, I tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this Boden sceptic could be persuaded . . . TOP TROUSERS . Colour-block coat, WAS \u00a3179, NOW \u00a3107.40; jumper, WAS \u00a389, NOW \u00a353.40; trousers, WERE \u00a369, NOW \u00a348.30; suede-heeled sandals, \u00a3119 (all boden.co.uk) I usually avoid Boden, fearing it will make me look frumpy. And on the hanger, these trousers look like a case in point \u2014 with their elasticated waist, they look like shapeless tracksuit bottoms. Once on, though, they\u2019re bang on trend, with slim legs tapering to an elasticated cuff. I\u2019d even wear them for an evening out \u2014 though perhaps in a plain colour. The jumper has three-quarter sleeves and cute French-knot decorations like little flowers. Meanwhile, the two-tone coat has been carefully considered, down to contrast stitching in the lining. The darker blocks are slimming, too, though the green is a bit insipid for my taste. 3/5 . FAB... IF I WAS 20! Dress, WAS \u00a3199, NOW \u00a3119.40; mules, WERE \u00a3119, NOW \u00a389.25 . At first glance, this dress looks like classic \u2018yummy mummy\u2019 Boden. And it does me no favours \u2014 making me look mumsy, busty and frumpy. That\u2019s not because the dress is dowdy, but because it\u2019s too fashion-forward \u2014 and I\u2019m too old to be wearing it. With its A-line Sixties silhouette and alarmingly thigh-skimming length, this is the sort of frock that might be found in Topshop. It would look fantastic on a lithe 20-year-old or someone more flat-chested. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t flatter this 42-year-old mother-of-two. It\u2019s hard to work out if this is a miss by Boden, or the company taking aim at a younger crowd. The mules are very on-trend, though, and, with their teetering heel, far from the sensible-heeled shoes I associate with Boden. 2/5 . PERKY PRINT . Geometric print dress, WAS \u00a399, NOW \u00a369.30; suede T-bar heels with green tassels, \u00a3119 . This purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from Boden\u2019s usual floral prints. It would work well on bustier women, as the smaller pattern on the upper half helps minimise larger breasts, while the plain band accentuates the waist. The length is just above the knee, so it\u2019s not too daring for those over 40 \u2014 though I wouldn\u2019t want it any shorter. Meanwhile, the shoes are fab. The T-bar heels are right on trend and come with a twist: contrasting purple toes and quirky green tassel detail. Usually, ankle straps make legs look shorter by cutting them off \u2014 but here, the strap sits lower down the foot, lengthening and flattering the legs. 3/5 . FIFTIES WONDER . Floral dress, WAS \u00a3139, NOW \u00a397.30; mules, WERE \u00a3119, NOW \u00a389.25 . On first sight, this look screams old-style Boden \u2014 a cotton shift dress in a flower print. But, unlike the shapeless floral shifts of old, this one is cut in a very fashionable Fifties shape, with a square neckline and tulip skirt. The viscose/cotton fabric has a sheen to it, which gives a luxurious feel, and the flowers are big and bold \u2014 almost abstract \u2014 with flashes of lime that stop it all from looking too girly. It\u2019s chintzy, but in a good way. This is also a slightly longer, more flattering, length and would be great for a wedding or summer party. The mules \u2014 this time in lime \u2014 are the perfect finishing touch. 5/5 . SLIMMING SKIRT . Cashmere jumper, WAS \u00a399, NOW \u00a349.50; print pencil skirt, WAS \u00a389, NOW \u00a362.30; suede-heeled sandals, WERE \u00a3119, NOW \u00a395.20 . I would never have guessed this pink and green, diamond-print, cotton pencil skirt was from Boden. It\u2019s a more eye-catching look than I\u2019m used to wearing, and I\u2019d usually shy away from crew-neck jumpers, too, as I think the high neckline accentuates my broad shoulders. But once on, the warm, pink sweater suits my pale colouring and the effect of the skirt is eye-catching, sharp and very slimming. The length is on the knee for me \u2014 but I\u2019m 5 ft 10 in, so for most women, this would come in just below the knee. With 3 per cent elastane, there\u2019s also a little forgiving stretch. I pair it with the suede sandals, this time in pink. Still love them. This look is a surprise hit. 4/5 . FLOATY DREAM . Cream silk shirt, \u00a399; floral skirt, \u00a399; sandals, as before . Oooh, this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit I remember my mum wearing in the Eighties. But will I look like a mumsy frump? While the skirt is in a traditional floral print, it\u2019s not made from plain cotton, as you might expect from Boden, but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay, so it\u2019s floaty and delicate. While the full skirt style isn\u2019t very slimming, it\u2019s a Fifties shape that\u2019s right on trend and swishes nicely. The blouse is very similar to those made by chic French brand Equipment, even down to the breast pocket detail. Except there, blouses will set you back over \u00a3200, while this is half that. Again, I love the shoes. These suede sandals are simple, elegant and very comfortable. 3/5 . EIGHTIES HORROR . Blouse, WAS \u00a369, NOW \u00a348.30; skinny pants, \u00a349; pointed slingback flats, \u00a379; leather bag, WAS \u00a3110, NOW \u00a382.50 . This is my least favourite look. The floaty, geometric top has a very Orla Kiely-esque print, but I think it makes me look dowdy. Meanwhile, the stretchy, navy pants give me nasty flashbacks to the leggings I used to wear as a teenager in the Eighties, and they make my legs look stumpy and lumpy. However, the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion-forward \u2014 designers ranging from Jimmy Choo to Antonio Berardi have brought out pointed, flat slingbacks this season. And the aqua bag is very ladylike. 2/5 . So, am i convinced? Ok, there\u2019s a lot that will keep faithful Boden fans happy, but I\u2019ve been reassured there are enough new pieces to make even sceptics like me look past its mumsy bright prints. In particular I love the shoes. They\u2019ve definitely persuaded me to put in an order.", "answer": "Clare Goldwin has forked out for pricey Boden clothes for her daughter .\nBut she has never wanted to be labelled a Boden 'yummy mummy' herself .\nThe brand seems to have its style and the fashion world is impressed .\nClare put a selection of their latest outfits to the test for FEMAIL .", "completion": ["Clare Goldwin reviews Boden's latest collection, highlighting the brand's shift from traditional 'mumsy' attire to more fashionable pieces, with the use of luxury fabrics and a toned-down colour palette, and praises their shoe range, despite her initial skepticism about the brand."]}

Nigel Farage today insisted the Tories had suffered a 'hammer blow' after a former parliamentary candidate defected to Ukip - only for it later to emerge that he had already been sacked from the party last week. Mike Whitehead, who was standing against Labour's Alan Johnson for the Tories in Hull, claimed he was joining Ukip after becoming 'disgusted' at the behaviour of the ruling Conservative group in his area. But the Tories this morning revealed they had already dropped Mr Whitehead as their candidate  after he revealed he was planning to stand as an independent against a Tory councillor. A spokesman for the Tories said: 'This man is not our candidate for Hull West and Hessle. He was sacked last week. 'We wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and could not stand for us at the General Election. We were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency. This is typical Ukip \u2013 cynical, misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points.' Mr Whitehead, speaking on BBC 5 Live this morning, confirmed he was sacked last week. He said: 'I got an email on Wednesday evening to say that if I didn't stand aside from my intentions to stand in the local elections, they would remove my candidacy in West Hull and Hessle. 'I said I wasn't prepared to do that and so as I wouldn't give them that guarantee they terminated my candidacy in West Hull & Hessle.' Mr Whitehead said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of Tories in East Yorkshire since 2011, when seven Conservative councillors from Haltemprice and Howden resigned, citing bullying and intimidation. He added: 'In my opinion, the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then.' Mr Whitehead said he could no longer carry on 'in good conscience'. Scroll down for video . Responding to the news, Mr Farage said: 'I am delighted to be welcoming Mike to the party at this exciting time. 'His move to Ukip just underlines that today the real party of opposition to Labour in the north is Ukip. It is another hammer blow to Tory pretensions in the north of England'. Ukip Yorkshire and Humber MEP Mike Hookem said: 'Mike has shown himself to be a man of principle in standing up for what he believes in and I am looking forward to working with him in the near future.'

Donny Ray Williams, who was once a staffer for the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee, slipped an intern Ambien in 2010 before having sex with her while she lay unconscious. That same year, he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent, prosecutors say. Despite admitting his guilt in December, D.C. prosecutors on Friday asked that Williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime - the effects of which will mar the remainder of his life,\u00a0Washington Post reports. No jail time: Former Capitol Hill staffer Donny Ray Williams is disfigured from an acid attack that occurred years after he raped two women. A judge on Friday agreed with a prosecutor's recommendation that he not serve jail time due to his serious injuries, for which he's undergone 20 surgeries and still faces more life threatening operations . The decision to give Williams a suspended jail sentence and 5 years probation - which Judge Robert E. Morin reluctantly agreed to - came despite one of his victim's request he be given 'some jail time.' 'He gave me a random dose of drugs and risked my life,' the woman argued in a letter read in D.C. Superior Court last week. The woman had just moved to Washington as an intern. She initially warmed to Williams because she believed he could help her get a leg up on Capitol Hill. 'After the assault, I moved away, and he continued to harass me and threatened me to drop the charges. This crime has caused me fear, pain and a financial burden,' she wrote. The other woman Williams raped was not present for the sentencing, during which Judge Morin said Williams 'was a victim of an independent crime and has serious medical issues.' Williams' own attack occurred in 2013 as he walked down a Washington street. A man approached him and tossed acid in his face that dripped down his body, he told the Post. 'I thought I was going to die,' Williams recalled. Acid attack: Williams was approached by a man in 2013 on a Washington street who tossed acid on his face. He believes a former girlfriend's jealous ex was behind the attack. He's now blind in one eye and nearly blind in the other . Massive second and third-degree burns put him in the hospital for two months, blinded him in one eye and nearly blinded him in the other. Williams believes the jealous boyfriend of a woman he was dating was behind the assault, the Post reports. Much of his face is now gnarled and disfigured and he currently has a massive lump at the top of his skull where doctors have surgically implanted a rod that stretches his skin in order to promote healing. He's undergone some 20 surgeries and still faces more 'life threatening surgeries. 'How easy it is for men to use power to abuse,' Williams said in court. 'Rape is cowardly, shameful and downright evil. I promise, I will protect a woman's right to her own body.' He'd previously denied the allegations against him, saying he only pleaded guilty because he wanted to focus on his health and not a trial.

'As wet weather is expected to continue across the remainder of Easter \u2013 I am urging all road users to slow down, adjust to the conditions and leave more room than usual between your vehicle and the one in front of you,' Assistant Commissioner Hartley said. The crash follows the death of a two-year-old girl on Friday when a ute rolled over in South Australia. A 33-year-old man died in another rollover incident in Western Australia the same day. A couple and their two young children also narrowly avoided an Easter tragedy after a head-on crash with an allegedly drunk driver in NSW's Hawkesbury region. A 29-year-old Stanhope Gardens man was travelling with his wife, two-year-old son and one-month-old daughter, when the crash happened in Webb's Creek on Friday afternoon. All four were uninjured, but all the airbags in the car deployed in the crash. The driver of the second car, a 54-year-old Lower Portland man who was also not hurt, returned a positive reading of 0.120. The man was later charged with mid-range drink-driving and driving an unregistered vehicle. He was issued a field court attendance notice to appear before Windsor Local Court on May 14.

{"input": "Known locally as Millionaires\u2019 Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for \u00a34million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties \u2013 Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives \u2013 that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of \u00a34 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg\u2019s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub. Stunning: The view of the sea from the property's modern living room. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors . Meet the locals: Singer Adele has a house in the exclusive cul-de-sac alongside comedian David Walliams . \u2018Bringing the sea into the house was the aim,\u2019 says Malcolm, a retired Harley Street doctor. \u2018Bizarrely, the former owners didn\u2019t make use of the sea views. So I opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs. \u2018Now, when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere. It took a year but it was well worth it. It still takes my breath away every time I come home. \u2018And sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect. I\u2019ve had a lot of impromptu parties.\u2019 Malcolm, in his 60s and the father of four grown-up children, bought the four-bedroom house in 2010 after moving from London, where he had seen Adele perform at the Roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time. So when the singer moved in to the cul-de-sac, he was \u2018starstruck\u2019. \u2018She has this lovely little dog and, in the summer, when all the doors are open, the dog wanders into my house and Adele comes round to find it. She\u2019s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well,\u2019 says Malcolm. Price \u00a34 million . Location Hove, East Sussex . Bedrooms 4 . Unique features Beach for a back garden; cinema room; huge dressing room; high-tech controls for hi-fi, curtains, lighting; celebrities on every side . He also welcomed Walliams and his wife, model Lara Stone, by taking round a bunch of flowers. Unhappily they have now split up. Cook popped round one day when he heard that Malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection. \u2018I thought he might buy the lot, but he didn\u2019t want any of them,\u2019 he laughs. The ground floor of Malcolm\u2019s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase, a media/cinema room, kitchen, snug and a 45ft lounge. Upstairs, the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby North Laine of Brighton. Malcolm\u2019s home has the latest high-tech automated systems, including a Lutron lighting control system, video door entry, digital music and video systems, integrated speakers, motorised curtains \u2013 in fact, everything a celebrity would be looking for. So who does he think will buy the house? Has Cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio? \u2018No he hasn\u2019t,\u2019 says Malcolm. \u2018I think he\u2019s happy with what he has at the moment. But whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful, ever-changing views. Like me, they\u2019ll fall in love with it straight away.\u2019 Selling agent Jason Brand says: \u2018This is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in Brighton, indeed the UK, to have direct private beach access.\u2019", "answer": "Hove promenade's white Art Deco houses are filled with British celebrities .\nSinger Adele and DJ Norman Cook among stars who own on beach front .\nThe properties were built between 1909 and 1910 by Michael Paget Baxter .\nOne of the  houses has gone on the market for a guide price of \u00a34million .\nBrandvaughan.co.uk, 01273 683111 .", "completion": ["One of the 11 white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac, known as Millionaires\u2019 Row and home to celebrities like Adele and David Walliams, has gone on sale for \u00a34 million."]}

Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . The officer has been named by the New York Daily News\u00a0as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's joint terrorism task force. Detective Cherry was trying to park his Hyundai without indicating when the Uber driver known only as\u00a0Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his car control skills. Detective Cherry is now under investigation by the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. President of the Detectives Endowment Association said Detective Cherry had been visiting his colleague Detective Harry Hill who had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and was very stressed. He said: 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health . 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts: 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that; that's not the way it works. How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai .

{"input": "How we work out the distance of something we can hear but not see has been somewhat of a mystery - until now. Scientists say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces. In a study they found that the reverberations of sound help us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby. Scientists at the University of Connecticut say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces (stock image shown). In a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of, for example, a car passing round a bend or a person nearby . The research was conducted by scientists from the University of Connecticut and published in the Journal of Neuroscience. They said that echoes and fluctuations in volume are the cues we use to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise. Researchers have long understood how we can tell a sound's direction - whether it's to our left or right, front or back, and above or below us. From their heavy build and short limbs, to the shape of their skull and teeth, there are many ways that the anatomy of Neanderthals differed to our own. Now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans, raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too. Researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a Neanderthal child, whose remains were discovered in France 40 years ago. The remains from the two-year-old child, which are known as La Ferrassie 8, were discovered at La Ferrassie in the Dordogne, south western France, between 1970 and 1973. Asier G\u00f3mez-Olivencia, an Ikerbasque researcher at the University of the Basque Country in northern Spain, produced a 3D computer reconstruction of the remains. His work, published in The Journal of Human Evolution, reveals another anatomical difference between the Neanderthals and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body. But how we tell how far away it is had remained a mystery. 'The third dimension of sound location was pretty much unknown,' said Dr Duck Kim, a neuroscientist at UConn Health. The researchers suspected that the effect echoes had on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. To explore the idea, they used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside rabbits' ears as they played sounds at different locations. They used these recordings to simulate modulated or unmodulated noise coming from different distances from the rabbit. Then the researchers played the simulated sounds back to the rabbit, and measured the responses of neurons in the rabbit's inferior colliculus (IC), a region of the midbrain known to be important for sound perception. When the rabbit heard the simulated sounds, certain types of IC neurons fired more when the sound was closer - when there was a bigger difference between the sound's maximum and minimum volume. The farther away the source of a sound is from a listener, meanwhile, the more echoes there are, and the more limited the changes in volume become. As the source moved further away, therefore, the neurons fired less and less. The researchers say that the effect echoes have on volume - or amplitude modulation - could be key in our ability to perceive a sound's distance from us. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, pictured, a person can't tell how far away a noise is from them . The results suggest that, as a sound gets further away, our brains are able to work out the differences in its maximum and minimum volume - and thus its distance. Dr Pavel Zahorik, a researcher at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, got the same results with human volunteers. Without amplitude modulation, for example in an anechoic (echo-free) room, a person can't tell how far away that noise is. 'Reverberation is usually considered a bad thing,' detrimental to hearing clearly, said Dr Shigeyuki Kuwada, co-author on the University of Connecticut study. 'But it is necessary and beneficial in order to recognise distance.' The researchers hope to investigate the problem further, and  tie together the perception of distance, horizontal and vertical directions of sound.", "answer": "University of Connecticut study reveals how we can measure distances .\nThey said that listening to echoes tells us how far something it .\nWhen a sound is close the differences in max and min volume are obvious .\nBut when it is distant, our neurons fire less, and we know it is further away .", "completion": ["Scientists at the University of Connecticut have discovered that we determine the distance of a sound source by listening to the echoes it produces, with fluctuations in volume providing cues to figure out the distance between us and the source of a noise."]}

Happily married:\u00a0Kim Jong-un is photographed with his wife Ri Sol-ju in Pyongyang in July 2012 . News that\u00a0Kim Jong-un is re-establishing the so-called 'pleasure troupe' was reported by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo. The tradition was established by the dictator's grandfather Kim Il-sung - who is considered the founder of North Korea and still holds the title of Eternal President despite dying in 1994. North Korean officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers, sometimes as young as 13-years-old, who are then taken to Pyongyang to work as dancers, singers or servants for the country's leaders. Often the most attractive girls are forcibly married off to powerful military generals as a way of rewarding the men for their all-important loyalty to the regime. As part of the handover of power following the death of\u00a0Kim Il-sung in 2011, the entire troop was dismantled and sent off to marry members of the North Korean establishment. But now that three years have passed it is thought acceptable for Kim to restart the tradition by finding his own girls.

The girls reportedly lived in the senior officials' houses and were traditionally allowed to marry their employers and 'retire' from service by the time they reached their early 20s. The three-year absence of the 'pleasure troupe' was due to a complete overhaul of the North Korean establishment by Kim Jong-un following his father's death.

The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when two members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage - uploading the photographs of Kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process.

Access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube was re-established after the social media sites agreed to remove photographs of the deadly siege, which Turkey has branded 'anti-government propaganda'. However Turkey has since threatened to block access to Google unless images of the siege are removed from its search function. The journalists group, Turkish Press Council, said that while it understood the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors' photographs, it said banning social media websites was in conflict with democracy. 'It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information - to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content,' the group said. Users meanwhile were sharing information on how to get around the ban on the Internet. Kiraz and both of his captors were killed when Turkish security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off.

Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. A British national, of\u00a0Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.'

Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Last year, Turkey blocked access to YouTube and Twitter after audio recordings of a secret security meeting or tapes suggesting corruption by government officials were leaked on the social media sites. Turkey's highest court, however, overturned the bans, deeming them to be unconstitutional.

The photographer admitted he has been chasing shots of skiers on volcanoes for several years and said he was thrilled to finally capture the image to perfectly contrast the hot and cold conditions. He said: 'It was a bit unreal seeing Oscar skiing near the lava. 'I was chasing this image for around five years and have tried, unsuccessfully, at many active volcanoes in South America, North America, Europe and Asia - but things always stopped me.

Mrs Fisher was thrown off the bed while the burglars took her purse containing \u00a3250 and a mobile phone from under her pillow. But the men continued to demand more money before Lewis struck the pensioner twice with a metal bar, leaving her covered in blood, prosecutor Philip Evans said. Her bed-ridden husband Mortimer, who was 85, was sleeping in another room and woke with a man standing over him, but was powerless to help his wife.

The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it\u2019s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring. The Church of England\u2019s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath\u2019s 45\u00b0C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. Bath Abbey (pictured) could have the world's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains.\u00a0The idea has been in the pipeline for years, but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it\u2019s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring . The Abbey, which lies at the heart of Britain's only World Heritage city, was granted planning permission for the unique \u00a318million scheme two years ago. Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground. They hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city's Roman roots. Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs, which heat water used in its Roan Baths. Waste water currently filters out to the River Avon but could be put to use under the new scheme . An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school . Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor\u2019s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system. Each day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon \u2013 passing through the Great Roman Drain. The idea is, that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted, it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy \u2013 enough to heat Bath Abbey and the world-famous Roman Baths and Pump Room complex. Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger, which transfers heat from one medium to another. A spokesman for the project told MailOnline that the investigations are in their infancy, but it appears that water levels may be too low to use in the Great Roman Drain area, but that energy could be harnessed in the Georgian part of the drain. A small scale trial is also underway to test how the heat can warm up different types of stone floors in the buildings. The Church of England\u2019s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath\u2019s 45\u00b0C spring water to power a modern heating system for the building. The idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the Great Roman Drain would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the Abbey (illustrated above) Engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the Roman bathing complex (pictured).\u00a0Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger . The plans for Bath Abbey's underfloor heating may use modern technologies, but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the Romans. The Romans came up with underfloor heating called a hypocaust, which heated houses and public spaces with hot air. The word comes from the Ancient Greek, where hypo means under and caust means burnt. Romans used underfloor heating, or hypocausts to heat rooms at Bath's intricate bathing complex. Here, you can see the pilae stacks though which hot air would have circulated to heat a tile floor on top . The floor was raised above the ground by pillars called pilae stacks and made of a layers of tiles sandwiched together with concrete. The air under the floor was heated by a furnace. Walls were also made of hollow bricks so hot air could circulate through them, as well as below the tiles. Rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace, the heat of which could be adjusted by adding more wood to the fire. It was labour intensive to sun a hypocaust as the fire needed a lot of fuel and constant attention, meaning underfloor heating was used in large public buildings, luxurious villas and bath complexes. Every day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon (pictured)\u2013 passing through the Great Roman Drain . The modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation. Once the investigation is complete, the ground will be covered back up and the engineers will work out how the thermal heat exchanger will be housed. Charles Curnock, Footprint Project Director from Bath Abbey, said: \u2018An innovative thermal heating scheme using Bath\u2019s hot springs ticks all the right boxes, while providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for both the Abbey and the Roman Baths & Pump Room complex.\u2019 Two years ago, Bath Abbey rector Edward Mason said: \u2018These are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted. \u2018The Abbey lies at the heart of what was once Roman Bath, and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows. \u2018As it stands, the water pours away and empties eventually into the Avon. \u2018Our plan is to remove the floor of the Abbey, dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church. \u2018It would provide virtually all of the Abbey's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint.'

A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled \u2018a disgrace\u2019 to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 who had \u2018brought shame on himself, his colleagues\u2019 and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were \u2018not very professional\u2019 but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. \u2018It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,\u2019 Rushton told jurors. \u2018But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.\u2019 He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging \u2018playful and flirty\u2019 text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with \u2018vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances\u2019 and he had \u2018sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them\u2019. Criticism:\u00a0Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: \u2018This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. \u2018We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.\u2019 He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation.

{"input": "London commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours. More than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables, causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely, and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: The scene in Holborn today, where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency: Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume: Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing: Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire, while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matin\u00e9e performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including\u00a0The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.", "answer": "Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .\nMore than 1,000 buildings remain without power as a result of the blaze .\nLocal businesses, government offices and tourist attractions are closed .\nCommuters have been warned to avoid the area as witnesses describe long queues of buses .", "completion": ["London commuters faced traffic disruption and thousands are without power as firefighters continue to battle an underground fire in Holborn that has been burning for over 24 hours, causing more than 2,000 office workers to be evacuated and major delays in central London."]}
{"input": "A married couple were killed in a light aircraft crash as they made a surprise visit to see family during the holiday weekend. David and Margaret-Ann Rous were on an Easter getaway when their private plane crashed into hills during bad weather in the Scottish highlands. The pair had arranged a secret visit using Mr Rous\u2019s light aircraft to see his wife\u2019s mother and sister on an island in the Inner Hebrides on Saturday. Newlyweds: Dr Margaret-Ann and David Rous died when their light aircraft crashed into a Scottish hillside while flying from their home in Dundee to make a surprise to see family on the the Hebridean isle of Tiree . Tragedy: The couple \u2013\u00a0who had been married for less than a year \u2013 were found in the wreckage of the aircraft . But when the couple failed to turn up at the island\u2019s airstrip and radar contact could not be made with the plane, a search party was scrambled. The wreckage of the plane and the couple\u2019s bodies were found in hills in Argyll six hours later as aviation experts said the flight may have encountered poor visibility. Shocked residents on the island of Tiree paid tribute to the \u2018wonderful\u2019 Dr Rous, 37, who had been married to the 28-year-old structural engineer for three years. The couple, who are understood to have been planning a family and to move into a larger property, can be seen revelling in married life in photographs posted online. Alongside images of their honeymoon in Venice, one poignant photograph, posted only months before the crash, shows the smiling couple wearing headsets in a plane cockpit. Dr Rous\u2019s sister Johann yesterday described the GP as her \u2018absolute rock\u2019, and said learning about the crash led to \u2018the hardest day of my life\u2019. Dr Rous met her husband when he visited Tiree, where she grew up, several years ago. Lives cut short: It is understood the couple were moving to a larger house and were planning to start a family . The couple lived in a \u00a3260,000 semi-detached house in Newport-on-Tay, just across the river from Dundee where Dr Rous worked as a family doctor. Neighbours said that despite Mr Rous often working away from home, the couple frequently held parties for them to make friends. Dr John Holliday, Tiree\u2019s local doctor for almost 30 years, said: \u2018I had known Margaret-Ann since the 1980s. She captivated everyone that knew her. She was absolutely gorgeous in every way. She became a much-loved GP in Dundee and I have no doubt that she was a wonderful doctor with her charm and great empathy. Surprise visit to see family: The couple were flying in Mr Rous's Piper Cherokee from Dundee, where they lived, to Tiree, where Dr Rous grew up, to spend the weekend with her mother and sister . Scouring the landscape: A Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, a Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet and an air ambulance were all scrambled to make a search after radar contact with the plane was lost . \u2018She immediately touched the hearts of everyone who came into contact with her.\u2019 Paying tribute to Mr Rous, originally from Gillingham in Kent, he added: \u2018He was a really nice man and a very talented structural engineer with a bright professional career ahead of him. \u2018Together they made a fine couple. We can only imagine what the family must be suffering. \u2018A cloud has fallen over Tiree, but the island community will come together as it always does at times like this.\u2019 Private jet: The couple were flying in a Piper Cherokee light aircraft (like the one above) when tragedy struck . The tragedy unfolded after the couple set off from Dundee Airport in Mr Rous\u2019s single-engine Piper Cherokee plane on Saturday. Radar contact was lost at around 1.50pm as they travelled over the remote Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Coastguard and Royal Navy helicopters, as well as an air ambulance, were called, and found the wreckage at 8pm on the northern side of Glen Kinglass, above Loch Etive. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is now examining possible causes of the crash. Local aviation expert David Howitt said that the conditions were poor at the time, adding: \u2018I have been taking weather readings here for 50 years, and on Saturday the weather was very, very dubious. There was some very poor visibility.\u2019 Iain MacKinnon, part of the coastguard team that searched the area, said: \u2018At the loch surface it was almost perfect visibility, but in terms of using the rescue helicopters they were very restricted.\u2019", "answer": "Dr Margaret-Ann Rous and her husband David were flying to Tiree to see her mother and sister .\nTheir bodies were found inside wreckage after the plane dropped off radar .\nCouple married last July and were believed to be planning to start family .\nDr Rous's sister Johann has paid emotional tribute to her 'absolute rock'", "completion": ["A married couple, David and Margaret-Ann Rous, were killed in a light aircraft crash in the Scottish highlands during a surprise visit to see family over the Easter weekend."]}
{"input": "The world's highest-grossing fast food chain will be sharing a little more of its revenue with its workers, as the company revealed plans to raise wages at its restaurants across the US. McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will increase starting wages for full- and part-time employees to a dollar over the minimum wage where company-owned restaurants operate. The company said the increase will be instituted starting July 1. It expects the average wage to be more than $10 an hour by the end of 2016, up from the current rate of $9 an hour. Fattening paychecks: McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will raise starting wages at its restaurants to a dollar over minimum wage beginning July 1 . McDonald's USA owns about 10 percent of the more than 14,300 McDonald's restaurants across the country, with the rest operated as franchises that will not be subject to the pay increases. The burger brand joins other large corporations raising basic pay against a backdrop of an improving economy and public pressure to increase wages. Workers at fast food chains, including McDonald's, staged protests last year, asking companies to raise wages to $15 an hour and demanding a union. Complaints in front of the National Labor Relations Board and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration have also alleged violations including denial of overtime pay and unsafe working conditions at the restaurant chain. Meanwhile, the economy has continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling from 6.7 percent to 5.5 percent over the last year. McDonald's USA President Mike Andres told the Associated Press that only a handful of McDonald's employees joined the demonstrations and that they didn't affect the company's reputation. Demonstrations: Labor organizers with a campaign to raise fast food industry wages to $15 an hour say they are fighting to unionize low-wage workers across various sectors . 'They're not taking a toll,' Andres claimed. 'It's a very competitive environment,' Andres stated. 'A significant rationale for this plan is that we want to be the most competitive and attractive employer.' Last month, McDonald's Chief Administrative Officer Pete Bensen hinted such an announcement could be in the works. Bensen said at the time that a big part of the turnaround effort in the U.S. would be what the company is doing 'around the employment image and our employee-employer relationship.' In addition to wage increases, McDonald's says workers at company-owned stores will get paid time off. Employees who have worked for the company for at least a year and work an average of 20 hours a week will be eligible to accrue about 20 hours of paid time off a year. Workers who don't take the time off will be paid for the value of that time, McDonald's said. Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald's worker in North Carolina, called the move 'too little to make a real difference.' 'Raising wages only a little for only a small fraction isn't change. It's a pure stunt,' she said in a conference call set up by labor organizers. McDonald's US business has been struggling, with sales and customers counts at established locations falling two years in a row. In January, the company named Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer, as its new CEO. That change took effect last month. 'We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald's restaurant experience,' Easterbrook said in a statement Wednesday. McDonald's also said it is expanding benefits to help workers at company- and franchise-owned restaurants complete high school and college. It did not immediately provide details on that program.", "answer": "The fast food chain will pay a dollar over minimum wage at its company-owned restaurants .\nThe pay hike will not affect franchise restaurants, which account for 90 percent of McDonald's locations .\nThe company was targeted in protests last year, with fast food workers demonstrating for a union and a $15 an hour wage .", "completion": ["McDonald's has announced plans to raise wages for full- and part-time employees at its company-owned restaurants in the US to a dollar over the minimum wage starting July 1, with the average wage expected to be over $10 an hour by the end of 2016."]}

The man, wearing an orange high-vis jacket, could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the M40 near Oxford. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle. Today his boss, who has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing, revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out of the door because he wasn't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air. These shocking pictures show a workman hanging out of the door of a van as it speeds down the M40 . The man can be seen leaning out the side door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the motorway . The incident, which police are investigating, is believed to have gone on for five minutes as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries. Dave Roy, a director at KJ Rail, said the man, the driver and their colleagues in the van would be hauled before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow morning. 'We're taking a robust approach to this and all of them will be in for a full disciplinary meeting first thing tomorrow,' he said. 'He's told me he was leaning out the door for some fresh air because he was feeling unwell and the next services were miles away. Having seen the pictures I'm not so sure. 'KJ Rail does not condone this sort of behaviour and takes a firm stance against it.' Mr Roy said the man could face the sack for the incident, which was captured by dentist James Hobkirk as he made his way down the M40, travelling south from Manchester to Kent. 'My wife was driving and she spotted something strange in the rear view mirror,' Mr Hobkirk, 37, said. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle .

KJ Rail, which owns the van, said it was investigating and that the man was likely to be punished . Thames Valley Police are also investigating the incident, which took place on Friday afternoon.

Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis. 'It is worth remembering that five people die every day on roads in the UK, and being in charge of a heavy, fast moving object has the potential to, and regularly does, kill and seriously injure individuals and tears apart families.

The sisters have teamed up with 'Print All Over Me' - an innovative online New York-based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and Buffalo shoes, the brand behind the Spice Girls' trademark platforms. Introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the U.S., the girls knew it was a match made in heaven. 'We both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together,' says Stef. Scroll down for video . Quirky collab: Sister duo Jess and Stef Dadon have teamed up \u00a0with  New York company ' Print All Over Me' Cocktails and creativity: The sisters are heading to LA soon for summer to launch new shoe line 'Twoobs' The photo-shoot was their own idea, which according to Jess they 'threw together' because they didn't think the collaboration on its own had enough of their signature look that is all about over-the -top colours and accessories. While the duo look posed and polished in the pics, they let us in on a little secret, according to the 'How Two Live' girls, they insist they don't actually like modelling, despite the 1732 posts on Instagram that would suggest otherwise. 'We don\u2019t like to model, so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they don\u2019t see us,' says Jess. Candy coloured palettes: Stef, 27 (left) and Jess, 22 (right) Dadon have over 111,000 followers on Instagram . Steph says they use the term 'modelling' loosely as they don't see themselves as professional models, they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes. The\u00a0photo shoot\u00a0which took place in Sydney's Luna Park provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy, clown-like\u00a0antics of the collaboration. 'They closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot. It provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop.' Model shy:The girls\u00a0admit while they love wearing clothes, they are actually camera shy . Theme this: Sydney's theme park 'Luna Park' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration . The shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand 'Buffalo Shoes' which are the same brand who sky-rocketed platforms into the mainstream  when they were famously worn by the Spice Girls during the 90s. 'We'd been collaborating with the guys from Buffalo shoes but we weren't sure what our following would think, so we posted a pic on Instagram and everyone has been dying over them - so it's had a great response,' says Jess. While the  photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes, the Dadon sisters had a lot of other projects  keeping them busy. Down-to-earth duo:  45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout . Pop princesses: The platforms  made by Buffalo Shoes are the same company made famous by the Spice Girls . First there's their new shoe label, titled 'Twoobs,' coming out in  June in America. 'We  did a shoe collaboration with Windsor Smith a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love,' says Jess. 'This first line will be all about sandals with  flat and platform soles,'she said. According to Jess,  platforms are a must because they're much more comfortable than heels - 'you\u2019re feet won't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height.' Flair for fashion: With a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a 'how-to' book titled #howtolive . Colour craziness: 'How To Live' have become well known thanks to their colourful Australian style . Questioned why America is their first market, the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal, especially as their based most of the year in Melbourne (known for it's southerly chill). 'We\u2019re going to go for three months then decide if we'll stay on permanently.\u00a0We love L.A., and we already have a fan base and  connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense,' says Stef. They also have a book in the works, with the very insta-worthy title ' #howtwolive' coming out in September. Celebrity scene: In their short two and a half years of blogging they've met  Rachel Zoe and Anna Dello Russo . The book offers 36 'how-two' projects including fashion, recipes and nail art ideas. As for more collaborations? There's more on the cards but according to the girls it's still under tight wraps at the moment. Not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure. The duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog's conception - with highlights including   Rachel Zoe at New York Fashion Week and  Anna Dello Russo when they guest edited for Elle Girl Japan. Fame and fortune aside, at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion. 'In the Australian blogging scene, everyone does the same thing, so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the Australian market,' says Jess. Patriotic pair: Despite business endeavours in the U.S. they take pride in representing Australian designers . And it's their vibrant and uniquely Australian approach that seems to be working. 'When we met Rachel Zoe we were wearing an amazing Australian designer Natasha Fagg and she came up to us and was like \u2018\"I love what you\u2019re wearing, you girls look so crazy,\"' says Jess. 'It also helps that we were wearing big sunnies, very Rachel Zoe,\u00a0she adds. 'We love to promote Australian designers when we're overseas. When we guest edited Elle Girl, it was so cool to have people from Japan come up and ask us who we were wearing,' she said . Despite their recent success, the duo from Melbourne remain down-to-earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes. 'It's flattering to receive gifts but we're a bit picky and it's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is,' says Jess.", "answer": "The stylish sisters 'How Two Live' collaborate with print and shoe brands .\nThe collaboration is with US company ' Print all over me' that lets you design and customise a print to wear or sell commercially .\nAlso featured  is Buffalo shoes, makers of the Spice Girls platforms .\nThe vibrant sisters have 111,000 fans on Instagram .", "completion": ["Melbourne-based fashion duo, Jess and Stef Dadon, known for their matching style, have collaborated with New York-based company 'Print All Over Me' and shoe brand 'Buffalo Shoes' for a new fashion project, and are also set to launch their own shoe label 'Twoobs' in America in June."]}

The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey \u2013 including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family \u2013 including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children \u2013 are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 \u2013 who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago \u2013 served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul.

He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization.

{"input": "Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . \u2018It's a completely amazing, strange match,\u2019 said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form.\u00a0Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. \u2018I didn't expect it to be so close,\u2019 Professor Sinclair said. \u2018We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.\u2019 Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: \u2018It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. \u2018This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.\u2019 Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are \u2018remarkably regular\u2019 in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. \u2018The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,\u2019 Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. \u2018A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,\u2019 the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.", "answer": "It is not known how fairy circles in the Namibian desert are made .\nClue may lie in the distribution of the\u00a0barren\u00a0circles of Earth in grassland .\nResearchers\u00a0in Japan discovered their distribution is similar to skin cells .\nLike human\u00a0cells, the mysterious circles typically have six 'neighbours'", "completion": ["Researchers have found a similar pattern in the distribution of human skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia, suggesting that both are fighting for space, though the exact reason for their similarity is still unknown."]}
{"input": "Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A\u00a0study\u00a0reported in the British Medical Journal found that\u00a090 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access:\u00a0Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower\u00a0rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures\u00a0come\u00a0just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary \u2013 costing the NHS \u00a3290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a \u2018self-treatable condition\u2019. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'", "answer": "Study: 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14 .\n10 per cent who couldn't amounts to 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts .\nSituation is\u00a0responsible\u00a0for a quarter of A&E visits, say researchers .\nProblem is more to do with lack of doctors rather than opening hours .", "completion": ["Almost 34 million GP appointments were unsuccessfully booked last year, contributing to a quarter of A&E visits, according to a study reported in the British Medical Journal."]}

Parts of its main building collapsed from explosions with workers still inside, according to at least five eyewitnesses and officials. According to the medical center in Hodeida, at least 35 workers were killed, many of them crushed by the rubble or burned to death. Two military officials said the factory had been used as a rebel weapons cache, and that while the airstrikes flattened the warehouses, the main factory building was only partially destroyed - suggesting it might have been hit from ground. All the officials and witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

{"input": "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This painting depicts Jesus Christ as single person but writer David Fitzgerald believes he was a literary invention that combined the stories from several cults and figures in Judea during the first century . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Historical researcher Michael Paulkovich has claimed that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist after being unable to find any verifiable mention of Christ in historical texts by 126 writers during the \u2018time of Jesus\u2019 from the first to third centuries. He claims that he is a fictional character invented by followers of Christianity to create a figure to worship. He says this is surprising despite his \u2018global miracles and alleged worldwide fame.\u2019 The 126 texts he studied were all written in the period during or soon after the supposed existence of Jesus, when Paulkovich says they would surely have heard of someone as famous as Jesus - but none mention him. 'When I consider those 126 writers, all of whom should have heard of Jesus but did not - and Paul and Marcion and Athenagoras and Matthew with a tetralogy of opposing Christs, the silence from Qumram and Nazareth and Bethlehem, conflicting Bible stories, and so many other mysteries and omissions - I must conclude that Christ is a mythical character,\u2019 he writes. \u2018\"Jesus of Nazareth\" was nothing more than urban (or desert) legend, likely an agglomeration of several evangelic and deluded rabbis who might have existed.\u2019 In a new book due to be published later this year, he will argue that the figure of Jesus was actually a combination of pagan rituals and stories about other people. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald, whose first book 'Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed at All' was published in 2010, believes it is no longer reasonable to assume there has to be a single historic figure who began Christianity. Instead he says early Christians drew upon the beliefs and rituals of other cults and faiths around in the first century. He argues that John the Baptist's cult is one such example and had initially been a competitor to the cult of Jesus before being incorporated into the Christian story. Mr Fitzgerald says there are inconsistencies in the Gospels of the Christian bible (pictured above) that suggest Jesus Christ was a literary allegory and these accounts were written decades after his supposed life . The statue of Christ the Redeemer (above) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of many depictions of Jesus but Mr Fitzgerald says that many of the early depictions were unable to agree on his appearance . Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' The earliest mention of Jesus yet to be discovered is a limestone ossuary on which the words 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' is inscribed. The box, which has been dated to 64AD - several decades after the crucifixion - was seized by the Israeli Antiquities Authority and its owner arrested for forgery in 2003. Although he was later cleared in 2012, doubts about the authenticity of the inscription remain. Others have said there could have been several people named James, whose father was called Joseph and had a brother called Jesus living in Jerusalem at the time. The James Ossuary (above) is thought by some to be the first mention of Jesus in an inscription on its side . There are three mentions of Jesus in non-Christian sources which have been used to research the existence of a 'real' Jesus. A Jesus is mentioned in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which was written around 94 AD. Rather than being born in a stable to a carpenter father, Jesus was actually the son of a successful, middle-class and highly intellectual architect. This claim comes from biblical scholar Dr Adam Bradford, who also says that between the ages of 12 and 30 - the so-called 'missing years' of Jesus' life, when little is known about him - he was studying at religious schools and became the highest-ranking rabbi in Judea. The radical revision of Christian history would suggest that, in preaching the spurning of worldly possessions for an austere life, Jesus may have been speaking from experience. Dr Bradford has analysed the Bible's original Greek and Hebrew scriptures to try to establish the truth about Christ's background. He says a mistranslation of the Greek word 'tekton' to describe the profession of Joseph, Jesus's father, is one of many mistakes that have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Christ's character. Dr Bradford claims that while 'tekton' is usually said to mean carpenter, it more accurately means master builder or architect. As an architect, Joseph would have had a higher social status that enabled him to better educate his son. Roman historian Tacitus later mentions Christ and his execution with Pontius Pilate in his Annals, thought to be written around 116AD. Both mentions were a considerable time after his alleged execution. Mr Fritzgerald also takes issue with many of the stories about the Crucifixion that stem from the first Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. He said: 'There are many examples of inconsistencies in the gospels that suggest they were written by people who did not live in Judea at the time they are set. 'Mark makes many mistakes about life and geography during the first century in Judea. 'If Jesus really had been arrested on the eve of Passover, they would probably have just put him in jail and tried him after the weekend. 'The trial itself violates the rules of Jewish law - why was he not stoned? 'What we know about Pontius Pilate also suggests he was someone who would not do what the Jews asked him and would often do what they asked him not to. 'Instead Mark portrays him as being persuaded by the Jewish leaders to execute him.' Mr Fitzgerald argues that many of these stories were in fact incorporated into the story of Christ as literary devices rather than as a historical account. He said: 'There is also no evidence for the tradition that sees Barabbas - an anti-Roman rebel and murderer - being released while Jesus, an innocent, is condemned to death. 'What this actually seems to be is Mark using the story as an allegory for the Yom Kippur scapegoat ritual where one goat is released into the wilderness and the other is sacrificed for God.' Mr Fitzgerald hopes to have his new book 'Jesus: Mything in Action' out later this year. He added: 'It still puzzles me that as soon as anyone tries to pin down who Jesus is we get 50 different Jesus's emerging. There is no consensus.'", "answer": "Atheist writer David Fitzgerald claims there is no evidence Jesus existed .\nThe San Francisco based author instead says Jesus was a literary allegory created by combining old Jewish stories and rituals along with rival cults .\nHe insists it is time to stop believing in Jesus Christ as a historical figure .", "completion": ["Writer and leading atheist activist, David Fitzgerald, argues that Jesus Christ was not a real person but likely a combination of stories about several different individuals, citing lack of contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts and discrepancies in the early gospels as evidence."]}

The mobile phone companies boasted that 4G services would be \u2018five times faster\u2019 than the existing 3G networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012. However, a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to 5.9Mbit/s per second on the 3G service that most people use. A study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised. Mobile phone companies boasted 4G would be five times faster than 3G. But the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second. Shown is an HTC One XL smartphone at a news conference in Zurich launching 4G in 2012 . At the same time, the evidence suggests that 4G services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them. 4G technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering. More than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of \u00a320 ($30) a month. The 4G speed data comes from the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the 3G services. Despite this, the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - EE, O2, Vodafone and Three - promised. Ofcom\u2019s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a \u00a312.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE\u2019s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s. This looks good when compared with its 3G service, which was a slow 4Mbit/s. Second fastest was Vodafone with 16.4 for 4G versus 6.6 for 3G. O2 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6, followed by Three at a relatively slow 8.5 for 4G which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for 3G. Upload speeds are important when sharing content, such as pictures and videos to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. EE was also fastest on this measure at 17.6Mbit/s, followed by O2 on 13.2, Vodafone on 13.1 and Three with 9.4. The Three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds, compared to 0.71 for O2, 0.76 for Vodafone and 0.77 for EE. There is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by 4G are slowing down. When 4G services launched at the end of 2012, the average download speed was up at around 19 Mbit/s, however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10. This has happened because more people are using the service, effectively causing jams on the airwaves. The only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones. Ofcom\u2019s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts EE, which is the subject of a \u00a312.5 billion ($18.5 billion) takeover by BT, on top. EE\u2019s 4G network, which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses, delivered the fastest average download speed of 18.6Mbit/s . The Ofcom figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle and Poole/Bournemouth - between October and December. Its study found that download speeds in Edinburgh fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year. The time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72. Ofcom admitted: \u2018As more people are taking 4G services from the mobile operators, this is likely to affect the average speeds being received.\u2019 The speeds for London were unchanged over the same period, while there was no data for the other areas. Claudio Pollack, Ofcom\u2019s Consumer Director, said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service. He said: \u2018People are increasingly connected, communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about. \u20184G is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and, as these services roll out across the UK, our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs.\u2019", "answer": "Study by Ofcom says 4G speeds in the UK are slower than promised .\nMobile phone companies boasted 4G would be 5x faster than 3G .\nBut actual figure is actually only 2.5x faster - 14.7 megabits per second .\nOut of the networks, EE was fastest, followed by Vodafone, O2 and Three .", "completion": ["The 4G mobile phone services in the UK are only 2.5 times faster than the existing 3G networks, not 'five times faster' as promised by the industry, and could slow down further as more people connect to them, according to a study by Ofcom."]}

Airbnb has plans for rapid growth in Cuba, where its employees have spent the last three months signing up property owners in advance of the expected crush of American visitors. More than 1,000 Cuban properties are listed on Airbnb, with 40 per cent located in the capital of Havana . Kay Kuehne, regional director for Airbnb, told the Associated Press: \u2018We believe that Cuba could become one of Airbnb's biggest markets in Latin America. \u2018We are actually plugging into an existing culture of micro-enterprise in Cuba. The hosts in Cuba have been doing for decades what we just started doing seven years ago.\u2019 Forty per cent of Airbnb\u2019s listings in Cuba are in Havana, while the rest are mostly located in tourist hotspots along the coast. With more than one million private listings, Airbnb\u2019s ambitious plans for Cuba are being hailed by AP has the most significant US business expansion on the island since the old Cold War foes pledged to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. One of the biggest hurdles Airbnb hosts are currently facing is the lack of internet access across the island . Property owners are welcoming the opportunity to make some extra cash in a country with a sluggish state-run economy, and they hope it will help to spur a revival on the island as they compete with hotels for business. Israel Rivero, who owns pre-war flat in central Havana and will charge $30 (\u00a320) a night on Airbnb, told AP: \u2018I think this is going to help our business prosper, to definitely improve, not just private business, but everything here.\u2019 Collin Laverty, owner of tour operator Cuba Educational Travel, said property owners have already been investing central air conditioning, improved water pressure and other amenities in order to be able to charge more than $25 (\u00a316) a night for basic service.

One of the biggest hurdles Airbnb hosts are currently facing is the lack of internet access across the island, which restricts their ability to check on bookings and respond to questions from potential guests. They also face challenges when it comes to accepting credit card payments, as they are unable to access much of the international banking system due to US sanctions that haven\u2019t been lifted. Mr Kuehne said Cuban and US authorities have welcomed Airbnb\u2019s expansion. But for the time being non-US travellers will not be able to book rooms or flats in Cuba through the website. With many hotels filled with non-US visitors, one of the biggest concerns about the return of American tourists in Cuba is a shortage of suitable accommodation.

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin.

The DHKP-C is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US, EU and Turkey. Two members of the DHKP-C and the prosecutor they held hostage inside a courthouse in Istanbul died after the shootout. Police had negotiated with the gunmen for six hours before the violent end to the hostage situation, according to Istanbul police chief Selami Altinok.

Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of Kiraz held during the armed siege last week. Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. The prosecutor, identified by state television as Kiraz, was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and hospital officials later announced he had died. Private news agency Dogan reported police special forces had entered the building, which was evacuated.

Confusion over Ukip\u2019s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set \u2018arbitrary targets\u2019. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of \u2018about 30,000 people a year\u2019.

The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.\u2019 Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party\u2019s cap: \u2018It\u2019s below 50,000 a year, all right? It\u2019s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . \u2018But this whole debate we\u2019ve been tied up with caps for five years.

{"input": "Almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the Iberian peninsula, stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers. Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El\u00a0Mir\u00f3n' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mir\u00f3n Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called El Mir\u00f3n Cave in Cantabria between Santander and Bilbao. After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. The Red Lady's remains were uncovered in 2010 during excavations of the El Mir\u00f3n Cave in Cantabria. After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained\u00a0the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects.

When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. But the fact she was buried within the living quarters of her peers has led the anthropologists to suggest she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. This status is also hinted at due to the presence of a primitive tombstone. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif  that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. 'Could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block?' said the researchers in their paper '\"The Red Lady of El Mir\u00f3n\". Lower Magdalenian life and death in Oldest Dryas Cantabrian Spain: an overview' published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. In addition there are lines engraved on the bedrock lower wall and ledge against which part of the corpse had been laid behind the block. The El Mir\u00f3n site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mir\u00f3n Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Morales. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC . Experts suggest the so-called 'Red Lady' was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy'. She would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas' and ate ibex, red deer and salmon. Her body was interred at the rear of the cave (pictured) where her peers would have lived and slept . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted, and researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. But, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual . The eastern face of the block was additionally 'intensely stained' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found, creating a link between the block and body. 'The ochre may constitute the only demonstrable \u201cgrave offering\u201d,' continued the researchers. 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mir\u00f3n. 'The corpse seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall. 'The head  would have been at the northern end of the burial. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position. 'Because many of the bones are stained with red ochre, it is possible that either the woman's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and/or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual.' Anthropologists from the University of New Mexico said: 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mir\u00f3n. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position [and] seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall' The cave site of El Mir\u00f3n is in the Rio As\u00f3n valley of Cantabria, Spain (marked). Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide) The cave site of El Mir\u00f3n is in the Rio As\u00f3n valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mir\u00f3n, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mir\u00f3n site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mir\u00f3n Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria. During the excavations, a large engraved rock was found. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that has been said to represent a pubic triangle, suggesting a female was buried nearby.\u00a0The eastern face of the block (shown on the left of this map) was also stained' with red ochre . After discovering a series of individual bones (plotted by red dots), researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed . In particular, its blood-red colour may have been symbolic of life and death. Following her burial, the anthropologists said the grave was partially disturbed by a wolf, or similar-sized carnivore. They then believe the skeleton was stained a second time and covered again. 'The scenario that is hypothesised is that the carnivore only minimally disturbed the skeleton, since the bones were unconnected by this time,' the experts continued. 'Then humans apparently found the exposed tibia and thus the rest of the skeleton. They may have removed the cranium and most of the largest bones without totally rearranging the fundamental anatomical order of the former corpse, whose hands may have been placed near her head and feet tucked under her bottom.' Using detailed mineralogical maps of the region, it is thought the Magdalenian people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern-day city of Santo\u00f1a, situated around 12 miles (20km) from the cave. 'Although lacking in clear grave offerings, the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment,' concluded the researchers. 'But, at the end of the day, we are left with a mystery: who was the \u201cRed Lady\u201d of El Mir\u00f3n and why was she given such special treatment after her death?'", "answer": "Remains of the Magdalenian 'Red Lady' were uncovered in El Mir\u00f3n cave .\nBones were stained with a red ochre made from a haematite crystal .\nGrave is the first burial of this kind found in the Iberian peninsula .\nHer identity and why she was buried in an elaborate tomb are unknown .", "completion": ["The remains of a woman, dubbed 'The Red Lady of El Mir\u00f3n', were discovered in a cave in Spain, dating back almost 20,000 years, providing the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region, and sparking questions among archaeologists about her status and the reasons for her elaborate burial."]}

Showbiz 411's\u00a0Roger Friedman said that the 66-year-old laughed when he asked her if Mia Farrow's son Ronan was her brother. He said that Tina, who is the daughter of  Sinatra and his first wife Nancy, told him: 'Couldn't be. Frank had a vasectomy before that. I don't know whose son Ronan is.' Scroll down for video . Frank Sinatra (left) underwent a vasectomy so could not have fathered Ronan Farrow, (right) according to his youngest daughter, Tina Sinatra . Mia Farrow had previously admitted the singer may be the father of her Ronan (both pictured) It has never been reported before that Sinatra underwent the medical procedure. In 2013, Mia Farrow admitted that Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son, instead of Woody Allen. Tina Sinatra, 66, ridiculed claims Ronan Farrow was her brother . Rumours . about the parentage of her son Ronan, 27, have long dogged the actress, and she addressed the issue in the interview saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' his father. Ronan Farrow later responded by tweeting: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.' Farrow, now 70, said that Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split up.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968. Two years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The couple adopted three children and also had three biological children before divorcing in 1979. In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. She and the children stayed in her massive Upper West Side New York apartment while he had a home on the other side of the city. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Earlier bonds: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow walk as Mia carries their son Satchel, who later changed his name to Ronan . 1966: Actress Mia Farrow married Sinatra in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. 1968: The couple split just 18 months after getting married and got divorced. 1971: Mia Farrow then married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn.They went on to adopt three children - Lark Song, Summer Daisy Song, and Soon-Yi - and had three biological children - twins Matthew and Sascha and finally Fletcher. 1976: Frank Sinatra married Barbara Marx.1979: Farrow and Previn divorced. 1980: Farrow started dating Woody Allen. They adopted two girls - Moses and Dylan. 1987: Farrow gave birth to a boy, Ronan, on December 19. Ronan was the only biological child of the couple. 1992: The couple split when Farrow discovered Allen was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. 1992 - 1995: Farrow went on to adopt six more children - Tam, Kaeli-Shea, Frankie-Minh, Isaiah Justus, Thaddeus Wilk and Gabriel Wilk. 1998: Frank Sinatra died. He was still with his third wife Barbara Marx at the time of his death after 22 years of marriage. 2013: Farrow has now suggested Sinatra may be Ronan's father as they never 'really split up'. Farrow gave birth to Ronan in 1987 - he was their only biological child. Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. The news that Allen may indeed be his father may not be welcome to Ronan - the pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic relationship with Previn. 'He's my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said. 'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. 'To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship. Allen later responded to Farrow's claims saying it was possible that Ronan was not his son. Allen wrote claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have been lying about it for decades. The Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, \u2018looks a lot like Frank\u2019 thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features. Allen said that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support. In a 2005 interview, Allen confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with Farrow. 'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than \u00a310,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch \u00a310,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts.

The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported \u00a3280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image.

Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least \u00a3400million when he died and the \u00a315million left to her was an \u2018absurd presentation\u2019 of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just \u00a31.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at \u00a341.5million, says she is owed a \u2018reasonable provision\u2019 following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as \u2018Black Jack\u2019, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled \u00a31.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow\u2019s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon\u2019s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal\u2019s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a \u00a31million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received \u00a315.4million and he also put \u00a320million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian \u00e9migr\u00e9 parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top \u00a31billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for \u00a358million - more than \u00a3700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for \u00a355million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for \u00a3130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a \u00a3150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around \u00a356million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple\u2019s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain\u2019s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth \u00a3400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a \u00a350million \u2018secret stash\u2019 hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a \u2018strong\u2019 case that her husband had access to \u2018very considerable resources\u2019, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: \u2018It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.\u2019 Mr Dellal\u2019s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal\u2019s wealth meant there was \u2018no prospect\u2019 of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an \u00a38.5million mansion in Regent\u2019s Park, central London, a \u00a33million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple\u2019s \u00a35million home in Hampshire, a \u00a31.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost \u00a36million and has investments in the Middle East worth \u00a326.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been \u2018somewhat diminished\u2019 recently, although Mr Dellal\u2019s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement.

With a habit of drinking about 16 8-ounce cups of iced tea every day, the unidentified man was consuming anywhere from 3 to 10 times the amount an average American takes in. The 16-daily-cups habit was striking on its own, since federal studies have found that the average US adult drinks about 10 to 11 cups of liquid every day, including water, coffee and other beverages.

Posted to Facebook two weeks ago, the loving image of Rosa Camfield and baby Kaylee became an online sensation before it was announced that Rosa had sadly passed away on Monday. But behind every picture is a story and Rosa's is every bit as inspirational as the photograph that captivated the Internet. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Rosa's granddaughter, Sarah Hamm, 33, detailed her grandmother's life from tumultuous youth in the Depression era, to a difficult divorce in the 1950s and all the way to her third marriage - to her childhood sweetheart - in her 80s. 'Grandma was always happy, I mean, she was smart as a whip, even at 101,' said Hamm. 'She was funny and had lots of stories.' Scroll down for video . Four generations of the same family: Rosa Camfield was born in June of 1913 and died Monday. Since this picture appeared on the popular Facebook page Life of Dad, she received millions of likes and comments from around the world . Hamm originally posted the photo a week before her grandmother's death after taking her daughter, then 2-week-old Kaylee, to meet her great-grandmother Rosa for the first time. Rosa had three children, five grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. 'It was actually the day she was being released in the hospital, so we were hoping that Grandma would get to meet her,' Hamm said. Soon after she snapped the photo, it ended up on Life of Dad where it became a massive hit. 'When I posted it I thought a few of our fans would feel connected to it as I did. Then, within an hour, it was clear that I had underestimated the impact it would have with people as it was shared and liked hundreds of times per minute,' said Life of Dad founder Patrick Quinn. As of Wednesday afternoon, the photo had received over 2.5 million likes and nearly 78,000 shares. 'I think its really sweet,' Hamm told ABC. 'My grandma would've loved this.' Like the few who make it to live past 100, Rosa Camfield had a lifetime worth of stories that her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren remember well. As a young woman: Rosa Camfield pictured above on her graduation from high school in 1931 . Rosa's youngest daughter Lynn Vine, says her mother was born on a fruit farm in Michigan in 1913. Rosa's family appears to have been relatively well off before and during the Great Depression. Her father was the first one in their town to have both a radio and a car, using it to bring locals to their home for nightly entertainment. 'Grandpa was the one who liked to have new things and he was quite progressive so they always had the first of everything,' Vine remembers. Vine says her mother lived in a time when kids still attended school in a one-room schoolhouse where children of all ages were taught by the same teacher. 'One year she was the only kindergartener the class,' Vine said. While Rosa wanted to go to college after school, her dad advised her not to. 'Her dad didn't want her to go to college,' Vine says. 'He said, \"You don't need to. We have plenty of money.\"' Rosa went on to marry her first of three husbands in the mid-1930s, a man named Rubin with whom she had all of her three children. Rosa pictured above with her three children, who she had with her first husband. From left to right: Lee Miles, Rosa Camfield, Raymond Wheaton and Lynn Vine . Rosa is pictured on her 98th birthday three years ago, surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren . Rosa and her 5-year-old great-granddaughter Mackenzie snuggle on her bed last month . Rosa Camfield started off as a farm girl, stayed at home to raise her three children and eventually got her teaching degree to work with 8th graders . While the couple were married, World War II broke out and the couple helped out by spotting planes. Unfortunately the marriage didn't last, and the couple divorced after about 15 years. It was after her divorce that Rosa decided to go back to college - while raising her three children in her 40s - and get her degree in teaching. She taught 8th Grade at Ludington Public Schools for most of her career - and one year her daughter Vine had her as a teacher. Rosa married twice more. Her second husband, Mert, died in the mid-1980s and she married for a third time, to her childhood best friend, Lennis Camfield, a few years later. Rosa and Lennis grew up next door neighbors and they would walk the same half-mile route to school everyday. Vine says her mother would always talk about walking to school in the winter, when she followed behind 7-years-old older Lennis to escape the snow  since the road wasn't plowed. Vine says it was obvious that Lennis was the love of her mother's life - despite the fact the two married in their 80s and only had a small amount of time together (Mr Camfield died in 1996). 'She was really heartbroken when he died...I know she wished she had longer time with him,' Vine said. Recently, Rosa had been living with one of her daughters. In November she was diagnosed with breast cancer, but remained active even in her final days - continuing to crochet and knit until about two weeks ago. 'Her opinion was if you're bummed out or whatever - get over it,' Vine remembers of her mother. 'Put a smile on your face, and things will be better the next day.' After Hamm posted the photo online, hundreds of people shared similar pictures.

Meanwhile Washington-based mom Breean Ferreira shared an image of her 113-year-old great grandmother and her one-year-old son - a family with five living generations. Grandmother Laura Kayizzi posted a photo of her own grandmother, who was born in 1915 and passed away this winter.

{"input": "It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. The researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart (shown above) Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. Scientists at Gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave. Their work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink, and also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain . Here are their main findings: . Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser:\u00a0This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull:\u00a0The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave:\u00a0This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world. Scientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft, for example. Professor Robert Ritchie, a materials scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was one of the co-authors of the research, said: 'Our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin\u2019s remarkable tear resistance. 'Collagen fibrils and fibers rotate, straighten, stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin. 'The movement of the collagen acts to effectively diminish stress concentrations associated with any hole, notch or tear.' To conduct the experiment the researchers used the skin taken from dead rabbits, carefully removed the hair and placed it in equipment designed to pull the skin apart. They then cut a small notch or hole in the skin and watched how it changed shape as the skin was stretched in a way intended to cause the tear to increase. However, rather than getting bigger as the skin tore, the notches simply yawned open. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, then used the x-ray beams produced by the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to study the structural changes that took place in the skin. They found the collagen in the dermis, the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin, changed its alignment at the edge of the tear. The collagen, which is normally in a disordered tangle, straightened and began to slide against each other to absorb the stress and provide extra strength. The researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle (shown left) to line up in straight parallel rows (shown right) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance . Dr Marc Meyers, a materials scientist at the University of California San Diego who also took part in the research, said: 'Straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase, and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation. 'This reorganization of the fibrils is responsible for blunting the stress at the tips of tears and notches.' Research on skin's mechanical properties dates back nearly 200 years, when physicians began examining stab wounds. The graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched (left) compared to bone (right) Unlike bone and teeth, which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress, the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress. The researchers behind the latest study are working with the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Professor Ritchie added: 'Natural inspiration is a powerful motivation to develop new synthetic materials with unique properties. 'For example, the mechanistic understanding we\u2019ve identified in skin could be applied to the improvement of artificial skin, or to the development of thin film polymers for applications such as flexible electronics.'", "answer": "Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used real skin samples to study microscopic changes that resist tears when pulled apart .\nThey found collagen fibres in dermis change structure when under strain .\nThe fibres go from being a disorganised tangle to straighten and stretch .\nScientists hope their findings can help develop new tear-resistant materials .", "completion": ["Researchers have discovered that mammalian skin has stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding, with the collagen fibers in the dermis straightening and stretching in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage, findings that could lead to stronger materials that do not easily tear."]}

While the Government is desperately trying to recruit more GPs, medical leaders warn the speciality has become unfashionable as junior doctors fear being overworked. The news comes amid a chronic shortage of doctors, and last week it was revealed that 10 per cent of patients tried - and failed - to book a GP appointment in 2013/14. Access to a GP is about to get even worse, as new figures show a third of GP training posts remain unfilled . This means patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year. Each August, junior doctors with two years experience after medical school begin training as either a GP or a hospital doctor. This year, 29 per cent of GP trainee places remain unfilled, at a time when there is already a shortage of doctors. In some parts of the UK, more than 60 per cent of positions remain unfilled,\u00a0sparking fears patients may struggle to see their GP. The figures, from the GP National Recruitment office website, were disclosed in an investigation by Pulse magazine. Overall, they show that more than 1,000 GP training posts are vacant. In the East Midlands, 64 per cent of posts are unfilled, with 63 per cent vacancy rate in the North East of England. In the West Midlands 47 per cent of posts are empty and across the south Coast 41 per cent of places remain unfilled. In 2013, the last time figures are available, there was a vacancy rate for GP trainee posts of 8 per cent at the same point in the recruitment process. Of the 12 areas across the England, Scotland and Wales, only London managed to fill its vacancies in the first round of recruitment. Doctors warn the figures mean we may be headed for a recruitment crisis, as there is already a shortage of doctors in many parts of the country . Two other areas \u2013 Kent, Surrey & Sussex and Thames Valley are expected to do so in the next round of recruitment. Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, chair of the British Medical Association's GP education committee told\u00a0the Telegraph\u00a0the figures show the country is headed towards a 'crisis' in GP recruitment. He said: 'We saw a significant decline last year and this is looking even worse \u2013 with more and more GPs retiring and not being replaced, we are heading towards a major recruitment crisis.' In many parts of the country, patients are struggling to get access to their GP because there are too few doctors. He said: 'Some practices are having to close their doors, others are reducing the level of service, because there just aren't enough doctors and ever more demands on them,' he said. He added junior doctors are opting to become hospital doctors instead of GPs as they fear they will be overburdened by work as a family doctor. The figures will be a blow Health Education England, the body responsible for GP recruitment, who had set a target to recruit 50 per cent of junior doctors to become GP trainees by 2016.

An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return. The star initially received widespread public support - including from his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron - in the aftermath of the incident, while one million people signed a petition calling for the BBC to reinstate him. Trio: Mr Clarkson is still set to appear in Top Gear live shows alongside Richard Hammond and James May . But director-general Tony Hall said 'a line has been crossed' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Lord Hall has faced death threats since he announced that Mr Clarkson would be sacked, and has had bodyguards assigned to protect him and his family. It is not yet known what Mr Clarkson's next move will be - he has been linked with a move to another channel, while the decision to continue the live shows has prompted speculation that he could continue to work with Mr Hammond and Mr May. It has also been suggested that Top Gear boss Andy Wilman, a childhood friend of Mr Clarkson, could be leaving the show, after an email to staff which was widely interpreted as a farewell to Top Gear was leaked last week. Last week it emerged that Mr Hammond and Mr May were each selling off several classic motorbikes from their extensive collections. The 12 cycles have a guide price estimate of \u00a366,000, but the novelty value could push up the price far beyond that - though Mr May insisted the sale was not linked to Mr Clarkson's dismissal. The co-presenter has mocked his own newfound unemployment since the incident, recently posting a video of cooking tips in which he instructs viewers how to make a shepherd's pie.", "answer": "Top Gear presenter was sacked after punching Oisin Tymon in the mouth .\nThe 'fracas' started when Mr Clarkson was told he couldn't get a steak at Yorkshire hotel after a day's filming .\nBut Mr Tymon told police he did not want to press charges .\nOfficers have now announced that Mr Clarkson will not face prosecution .", "completion": ["Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show."]}

Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar.

However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue.

{"input": "Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year. He left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged . A violent thug who ended a soldier's career with one punch because he wasn't given a cigarette has been jailed for seven years. Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army. 'He was doing his bit for the United Kingdom and served abroad and served in combat and it seems highly unlikely he will return to his career. Your one punch destroyed that.' The court heard Anderson first attacked Adam Crosby at a bus stop in Hartlepool town centre on July 26 last year. He was angered that he only offered him the remainder of the cigarette he was smoking. Mr Crosby had to take a month off work at his family firm after he was left with a fractured cheek bone and damage to his teeth and nose. Anderson then walked to a nearby bus stop where L/Cpl Duffy was waiting and punched him to the ground after he failed to produce a cigarette. The soldier was left him slumped on the ground, bleeding from his ears and in a coma for 14 days. He sustained a fractured skull and needed two rounds of surgery after suffering haemorrhages, with part of his brain being removed. L/Cpl Duffy, from Darlington, County Durham, was a member of the 3 Rifles Infantry Battalion and had served in the Army for more than ten years, seeing colleagues killed and injured in Afghanistan. Teesside Crown Court heard\u00a0Lance Corporal Albert Duffy's military career had been ruined by the attack . He escaped with his life in 2009 after a vehicle he was in hit an improvised explosive device. He was blown 15 feet into the air, but suffered only a broken foot. Since the attack, he has gone from one of the fittest in his battalion to a man who struggles to put together sentences, the court heard. He also has hearing problems and has little short-term memory, the judge was told. His mother, Marie Briggs, says she no longer recognises him as the caring son once looked up to by his seven siblings and her three-step children. In a statement to the court, L/Cpl Duffy said: 'I don't know what I'll do if I don't have the Army in my life and I have fought for my country. 'I find it difficult to comprehend how my life has been ruined by a male from Hartlepool, who punched me for no reason.' Fellow-victim Mr Crosby told the court: 'I'm 25, I should be enjoying myself, but this attack has had a massive affect on me.' Robin Turton, prosecuting, said when Anderson was arrested on July 30, he asked police: 'Is that me you're looking for in the paper' after seeing headlines as officers appealed for help. He also asked about the condition of one of the victims, but made no comment when he was interviewed. L/Cpl Duffy and the other victim, Adam Crosby, were set upon at a bus stop in Hartlepool in July last year . Mr Crosby's blood was found on clothing seized from Anderson's home in Hartlepool. Anderson admitted grievous bodily harm against Mr Crosby and grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack on L/Cpl Duffy. He was sentenced to two years for the attack on Mr Crosby and seven for the assault on L/Clp Duffy to run concurrently. Neil Mullarkey, mitigating, said Anderson had started to tackle his drink problem since he was remanded in custody. He added: 'He is disgusted with himself and thinks about what he has done every day and is ashamed.' The court heard that Anderson already has 19 convictions for 39 offences, including punching and head butting two women in a takeaway and an assault in which he used a pool ball in a sock to attack a man in a pub. But Recorder Mr Palmer stopped short of classifying him as a 'dangerous offender', which would have allowed the judge to jail Anderson indefinitely.", "answer": "Soldier survived bomb blast in Afghanistan during 10-year Army career .\nHe was victim of unprovoked attack in town centre after returning to UK .\nPunch left him severely brain damaged and ruined his military career .\nAttacker - who has string of past convictions for violence - is jailed .", "completion": ["Keith Anderson has been jailed for seven years for assaulting two men, leaving one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged, because they didn't give him a cigarette."]}

{"input": "Most mothers dream of their children's birthdays, graduations and weddings. But Jodie Barden has the heartbreaking task of arranging both her daughters' funerals, knowing that neither will make adulthood because of an incredibly rare illness. Mrs Barden, 28, is mother to eight-year-old Ella and one-year-old Chloe, who both suffer from Cockayne Syndrome and have a life expectancy of just 12. Cockayne Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, which is characterised by a failure to gain weight, premature ageing, an underdeveloped nervous system and a small head. Scroll down for video . Jodie Barden, 28, has been forced to plan her daughters Ella, eight (left) and\u00a0Chloe, one (right)'s funerals as they have rare genetic disorder Cockayne Syndrome which gives them a life expectancy of just 12 . In 2013, Mrs Barden shaved her head in order to raise money for a Cockayne Syndrome charity. She is pictured here with daughter Ella, who ages prematurely due to the syndrome . Sufferers usually don't live to see their teenage years and usually die from pneumonia. Given her children's prognosis, Mrs Barden has already made arrangements for both daughters' funerals with her husband, Luke, who is also 28. The former graphic designer, who is now the girls' full-time carer, said: 'There's no cure for what they have and there's not much the doctors can say, so we just try and keep them comfortable while they're with us. 'They'll eventually lose their sight and hearing and, when that time comes, we want to be able to provide them with somewhere where they can still have fun.' The condition causes premature ageing, so despite the fact the girls are seven years apart, they look like they are a similar age. Ella currently has a tremor, which makes drinking from a beaker difficult, and she only says words like 'yes' and 'juice'. Chloe isn't walking yet and probably won't ever reach this milestone. But while they cannot speak, Mrs Barden said they do not fail to communicate their desires through gesturing. She said: 'They are both such good fun - real cheeky monkeys.' She describes the moment she was told her children had the disease as 'devastating'. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging (a form of progeria). People with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, and they have an 'aged' look. It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose. For CS patients who are affected at birth, life expectancy is 3\u20137 years. Other patients only start to show symptoms in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years. However, some rare CS patients live significantly longer. Individuals with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours. CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'. Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. One of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture occurred in the 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring Brad Pitt). The main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and ages backwards; a scenario inspired by progeria. She said: 'Ella was diagnosed at Great Ormond Street in 2012 when we noticed she wasn't hitting her milestones; when she didn't start talking when we expected her to. 'I was pregnant with Chloe at the time and that's when we found out she would be born with the same disease. 'It was devastating, but once we got over the shock we decided we would do all that we could to make their lives memorable.' The disease is inherited and Mrs Barden and her husband, a HGV driver, both carry the mutated gene. They have a one-in-four chance of conceiving a child with Cockayne Syndrome, whereas the odds are usually two in a million. Now, she and her husband are trying to make the most of the time they have with their daughters, as well as their four-year-old son Alex, who does not suffer from the disease. Mrs Barden said her son is 'fantastic' with his sisters. She said: 'He's genuinely loving and has a very caring nature. 'If either of the girls drops something on the floor he will just pick it up without being asked. 'We will always be honest with him. 'The girls are always happy and never moan, they keep smiling despite everything they've been through.' She added that her husband is incredibly supportive, and the whole extended family have helped them through a difficult time. She said: 'It's a test of anyone's relationship, but luckily Luke and I have always been very close. 'We're also lucky to have support from both sides of the family.' They have collectively raised around \u00a314,000 for charity Amy and Friends, a Cockayne Syndrome charity based in Liverpool. This was done through a series of events including skydiving and hosting coffee mornings. Mrs Barden even shaved off her hair in January 2013. And in the same year, Ella, who uses a wheelchair and walking frame to get around, appeared on a special episode of The Jeremy Kyle Show for Mother's Day. Mrs Barden said the whole family is now trying to make the most of the time they have left with the girls. Her son, Alex, four, is 'fantastic' with his sisters, she said . The reality television presenter paid for her to dress up like a princess and climb the Eiffel Tower. And last year, they flew to Melbourne and the Gold Coast in Australia where Ella swam with dolphins. Mrs Barden said: 'We met up with another family with Cockayne Syndrome over Facebook. Essex charity, Wipe Away Those Tears, is sending the family to Disneyland Paris for an Easter holiday. In the meantime, Mrs Barden is taking on a Tough Mudder event in September.

{"input": "Benefits and welfare schemes are often blamed for making people less likely to want to work. But a study has found that the opposite may be true. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job.\u00a0In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% did . In Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, . By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did. The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010. People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor. The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues. Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.' And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent. The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money. 'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'. 'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money . 'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state. They also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. 'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.'

The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation's account and enjoyed dining alone on several \u00a3300 meals a month and also spent money on flowers, a court heard. His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. He was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court. Prosecutor Tony Prosser said Howard secretly sacked auditors and then presented the association with fake accounts each month. Between 2011 to 2013 he freely dipped into the money and lavished cash on himself and his family. When his crime came to light just \u00a3180 was left in the association's savings account when it should have been nearly \u00a380,000. Howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay \u00a320,000. Mr Prosser said police found he had blown thousands on meals, groceries, flowers, expenditure in France, hotels and even sending money to his wife. Howard, who admitted fraud by breach of trust, claimed he only took \u00a367,000 and had now put his home up for sale in a bid to repay some of the money. Dominic Webber, defending, said Howard got into debt and used the money to pay bills and was 'extremely sorry for what he has done.' Matt Findel-Hawkins, a former OPMA president, said: 'It wasn't like he was paying off debts to some evil Shylock figure. This was blatant, categorical deceit over time. His fraud was only uncovered after OPMA had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. The non-profit trade association services the international advertising community . 'At the same time he would sit there in meetings, smiling at us.' Mr Findel-Hawkins, sales director for Nikkei Europe, said Howard had been a member of the non-profit organisation for 30 years. He said: 'We'd have meetings and all go to lunch. He was a steady guy with a nice sense of humour. 'That's why he was our treasurer. We've been trying to work out what went wrong. If I ever spoke to him again, I'd just want to know why he did it.' Sentencing, Judge Simon James told Howard his victim was a not-for-profit organisation which had been operating for more than 80 years. 'Under your three-year tenure as treasurer - in which you seemed to treat its bank account as your own - they were left close to bankruptcy and perilously close to folding,' he said. 'Your good name has now been well and truly lost. This was a systematic, prolonged and flagrant piece of dishonesty. Howard was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court today . 'It seems to me the money was used to fund a comfortable living for you and your family rather than out of real desperation.' Detective Constable Barry Carr described it as a 'serious abuse of position' and said Howard had shown a 'flagrant disregard for the trust and responsibility placed in him'. He added that his deceit had nearly brought the long-established organisation to its knees financially.

{"input": "Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member \u00a0bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year,\u00a0details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party\u00a0for Tory researchers at the party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester,\u00a0funded by Conservative MPs\u2019 expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter.

A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 . Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains . 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

And drought-weary Californians, who can't expect much encouragement from mountains elsewhere in the West: Snow that fills the Colorado River is lagging, too, officials said Friday. The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars . The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup . A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

{"input": "The UK is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer-stricken five-year-old Ashya King made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment. Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy . Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received . Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost \u00a3100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and\u00a0Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment . Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of \u00a3100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last month.", "answer": "The three centres are planned for Cardiff, London and Northumberland .\nThey will offer proton beam therapy to private and NHS cancer patients .\nHoped the first centre in Cardiff will be up and running by next year .\nAshya King, five, made a 'miracle recovery' after receiving the therapy to treat a brain tumour .", "completion": ["The UK is set to open its first three proton beam therapy centres for cancer patients in Cardiff, London, and Northumberland by 2017, following the recovery of five-year-old Ashya King who received the treatment in Prague."]}
{"input": "David Cameron has brushed off criticism that he is too posh, insisting he will not change the way he acts or speaks to win voters. The Prime Minister is apparently so proud to be posh he was happy to be pictured eating a hotdog with a knife and fork. The bizarre dining etiquette during a campaign visit to Dorset was almost certainly designed to avoid a repeat of Ed Miliband's disastrous attempt at eating a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video . David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset . It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year . Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions. And in March 2012 he was said to have tried eating one sideways while at a basketball game with President Obama. He also sparked a mini-storm after opting for ketchup of mustard, the condiment of choice for many Americans. The Prime Minister obviously enjoyed his lunch, and was pictured leaning back in his chair in the sunshine . In a new interview the Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing, and refuses to change the way he speaks or behaves . While aides may worry about the impression Mr Cameron gave by eating his BBQ food with cutlery, the man himself is unconcerned. In an interview to be broadcast tonight, he makes clear he is not going to change the way he behaves to hide his 'poshness'. The Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing. He tells ITV's Tonight programme: 'I went to a very posh school, I had a very privileged upbringing with parents who were incredibly loving and brilliant.

{"input": "A car salesman who was high on cocaine murdered a prostitute by stabbing her 44 times before raping two more women at his home while his partner enjoyed a Christmas night out. Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December. As she lay dead on the floor, the father-of-two called two more vice girls over to his family home and raped them before they managed to flee while still naked. His young son was asleep in the bedroom next door while he carried out the horrific crimes. Mathieson, who has previously been described as of 'impeccable character', pleaded guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow today and now faces life in prison. Steven Mathieson, 38 (left), stabbed prostitute Luciana Maurer, 23, (right) dozens of times in a frenzied and unprovoked attack at his home Falkirk, Stirlingshire last December, while his partner was on a night out . The court heard how the crimes occurred while he was left babysitting his young children while their mother - his partner of 10 years - enjoyed a night out. The family had spent the day Christmas shopping on December 4 last year and enjoyed a meal before returning home. Mathieson - described as being his 'normal self' - then dropped one of his children at his grandmother's home before returning to his house \u2013 in a quiet residential neighbourhood - with his younger son. His partner left the property for a work night out and he sent her a text which said: 'Have a good night. Love you'. However, soon after he had put their young son to bed, Mathieson used his phone to arrange for sex while his partner was out. The court heard he regularly used sex phone lines but hid it from his long-term partner. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was one of the escorts who arranged to meet him. The 23-year-old, who had arrived in Scotland just a few days earlier having moved up from London, arrived at his property at about 11pm. However, within minutes, Mathieson \u2013 who was high on cocaine - stabbed her 44 times and cut her throat. Mathieson then sent a text to his partner which said: 'Sorry xx'. His young child was asleep in the room next door while he carried out the harrowing crimes. The court heard how Ms Maurer had defensive-type injuries suggesting she had tried to fend off her killer. Two other escorts, who Mathieson had summoned, then arrived at his home, completely oblivious to the murder which had taken place. Ms Maurer, a Romanian-born mother, was stabbed 44 times by\u00a0Mathieson and had her throat cut . When they arrived, they found Mathieson casually sitting on his sofa in the living room before he led them upstairs. Describing the horror that then met them, prosecutor Jane Farquharson said: 'Mathieson went into the bedroom first. 'He put on the light and hung back at the door whilst the women walked in. 'As soon as they entered the bedroom, they saw the deceased, lying on her back and on top of the double bed.' Mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door. One of the women begged Mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away, the court heard. He initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands. Miss Farquharson: 'He told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him. 'In fear of what he might do and, with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them, each did as they were told.' Mathieson went on to rape the pair, aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside Ms Maurer's dead body. The pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs. Once there, Mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again. Miss Farquharson said: 'Over the course of the assault in the living room, he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs. 'He appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both: 'I'm going to be many years in prison because I killed that girl. 'I've done this to show my wife something.' Mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and, sensing an opportunity to escape, the women ran for the door. Mathieson tried to chase them, striking one on the leg with a knife, but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid. Miss Farquharson: 'Both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help. They were crying and appeared to be terrified.' After the women escaped, Mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator: 'I've been high on drugs and I've killed a prostitute. 'Tell the officers I am not aggressive. I'm sitting on the couch. I had two other girls, but I've let them go.' Mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up. He got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him. Mathieson, a car sales manager, carried out the horrific crimes at his home in\u00a0Falkirk,\u00a0Stirlingshire (above), while his partner went on a work night out. He is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape . His partner, clueless as to what had happened in her absence, arrived back at the family property at about 2am. She was described as being 'hysterical' upon learning what had happened. Mathieson, a sales manager, was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month. His court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick. In what is rarely seen in court, his QC Donald Findlay left his own seat to sit beside Mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued. The court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes, but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor. In the spring of last year, he had started attending Cocaine Anonymous having built up a large debt. His girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed, the court heard. Mr Findlay, defending, said that before his crimes Mathieson had been of 'impeccable character', but said he now accepted 'full responsibility' for his actions. Judge Lord Bannatyne deferred sentencing until May 7. Speaking after the hearing, detective inspector Dave Pinkney, from Police Scotland, said: 'The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults. 'Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. 'Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences. 'I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation. 'While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson's actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.'", "answer": "Steven Mathieson, 38, stabbed 23-year-old escort Luciana Maurer 44 times .\nAs she lay dead on the floor, he raped two other prostitutes at family home .\nCrimes\u00a0occurred\u00a0while his partner was out and son was asleep in bedroom .\nMathieson, who was high on cocaine at the time, now faces life in prison .", "completion": [" "]}

Across its side, the lettering reads 'Illinois Dept. of Corrections' in accordance with the film's plot . The wreckage has since become a tourist attraction 23 years after the memorable action scene was shot . Harrison Ford's character Dr Richard Kimble is pictured leaping off the bus in the scene where he escapes while being transported to prison . The Fugitive was the must-see film of 1993, winning plaudits from critics and the audience alike. It grossed a staggering $370million. Fans of the film will recognise the inside of the bus where Kimble tried in vain to save prison officers and fellow inmates, before narrowly avoiding certain death by jumping from the vehicle seconds before the train hit. 'Illinois Dept. Of Corrections' can still be seen written on the trashed prison bus in accordance with the film's plot. The trains were bought specifically for the epic scene at $22,000 per carriage. The crew used pusher trains to make it go faster for a bigger impact. The 100 strong crew spent two months on location in the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina to carefully plan the impact, which lasted a heart-stopping 60 seconds. The short action sequence cost an eye-watering $1.5million to shoot as it used only minimal CGI . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene and three were destroyed in the process . The inside of the bus will be familiar to fans of the film as the location where Harrison Ford's character attempts to free fellow prisoners before leaping out of the path of the oncoming train . The train is now covered in grass and weeds after sitting abandoned for more than two decades . Director Andrew Davis used 13 cameras to film the scene; three were destroyed in the process. Most camera were operated remotely so to avoid injury to cameramen. Speaking in 2013, Mr Davis said: 'I'm glad CGI wasn't available when we made the Fugitive, not only was the train crash very effective because you really felt it and saw it, but the next day when the marshals show up and there's aerials of it, that would've been a nightmare to try and put all that in digitally and have people reacting to nothingness.' According to Mr Davis, what you see in the sequence is 95 per cent real footage. The only part that was super-imposed was the moment Kimble leaps out of the way of the train. In the film, the bus is a prison transport which crashes when fellow prisoners attempt an escape .

Two residents from the Osborne Apartments on West 57th Street in Manhattan told the\u00a0New York Post of their experiences with spirits in the building. Chastain and her boyfriend, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, spent $5.1 million on an apartment that features four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, Daily Mail Online\u00a0reported\u00a0early last month.

The Osborne is located close to Carnegie Hall and is a few blocks away from Columbus Circle, Central Park and Lincoln Center. One of The Osborne's longtime residents, Naomi Guffman, recently told the Post 'I have a poltergeist!' She thinks the ghost is actually one of the apartment's former tenants, Metropolitan Opera singer Johanna Gadski, according to the newspaper. The Post described Gadski as 'a red-haired practical joker' who was killed in a 1932 Berlin car accident. Guffman told the Post '[Me and my husband would] be standing in the hallway talking and the toilet would start to flush.'

The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. Separately, police detained a gunman on Wednesday who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election. Today, the grieving family of Mr Kiraz who died after being shot in the head and chest during yesterday's courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.

Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Justice Minister Kenan Ipek said the two members of the DHKP-C who took him hostage had 'held a gun to the nation'. 'We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,' he said at a ceremony for Mr Kiraz. 'Our state is powerful enough to track down those behind these lowlifes... The fact these assassins are dead shouldn't put those nefarious and dark forces at ease.'

Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz, a father of two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Police chief Selami Alt\u0131nok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head.

Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. Gunshots: According to the\u00a0Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul.

{"input": "From location tagging to unmonitored comments to blatant sexual harassment, a new video streaming app has all the ingredients to become a parent's latest nightmare. Periscope, Twitter's new iPhone app which allows users to broadcast live video and audio online, launched a week ago today and early adapters have already discovered potentially hair-raising issues with the much talked-about technology, which claims on its website that it is 'the closest thing to teleportation'. Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of the app, which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news, there are already a concerning number of users, particularly women, reporting that they have been sexually harassed, or trolled, while using the technology. Streaming revolution: Periscope, an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet, launched last Thursday . Warning: App developer Justin Esgar is warning parents about the app's various 'land mines' and insists that they need to monitor their child's use of it (stock image) Justin Esgar, App Developer of the app Goodnight, told Daily Mail Online that because Periscope 'allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before', there are 'apparent dangers' that users have to consider before accessing it. Emma Barker, sex and relationships editor at\u00a0Cosmopolitan.com, noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends. She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate. They were fully clothed, sitting on a couch and casually conversing, yet 'within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up\u2019, asking for the women to \u2018show butt\u2019. While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor, the lude comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as: 'Show boobs', 'Age?' and 'I would soooo swipe right on both [sic]!' One particularly creepy user asked: 'Do you get out of the shower to pee?' According to Periscope's community guidelines, the app prohibits 'pornographic or overtly sexual content' as well as 'explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent, illegal or dangerous activities'. And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review, there doesn't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment. The app's policies are, unsurprisingly, similar to Twitter, which is currently testing out a 'quality filter' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds. It's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system. But the recent reports of harassment and bullying have sparked concern among parents of many of the children and teenagers who currently have access to the app \u2013 raising questions about whether it is truly safe for young people to be using it, given that they could potentially be opening themselves up to all manner of abuse, be it of a violent, or sexual, nature. Another startling revelation about the app, was revealed by Fast Company\u00a0editor Rose Pastore, who was testing out the app and learned that it had a major privacy flaw. According to Rose, if users neglected to turn off the location sharing feature, their video streams would be accompanied by a 'zoomable' map which allowed others to pinpoint their exact locations down to the intersection. Thankfully, Periscope disabled the zooming feature on the map as a part of its first system update, but the app still enables locations. Special features: The app, which is owned by Twitter, allows users to follow certain people (L) and scroll through a 'Watch' feed of live videos (R) Mr Esgar noted: 'Periscope requires not only your camera and microphone, but access to your location [if you want to broadcast video]. This means not only are you sharing your video, you are letting other users know where you are.' He added: 'That means your children potentially being found by, best case, a disgruntled ex-spouse. The worst case clearly presents even higher levels of danger. You can easily search for users of the app, even if their Tweet streams are privatized.' Periscope does enable users to hide their location once they begin broadcasting - but many users admit they didn't think to disable the feature before starting their video stream. While testing the app, Mr Esgar said he watched\u00a0Kevin Jonas and his daughter ride bicycles, a German man drinking, comedian Jim Gaffigan getting his hair washed and an office learning about Periscope. 'I don\u2019t know or follow any of these people on Twitter but there it was, all live for me to watch on my train ride home,' he said. And while Periscope has provided guidelines for content, Mr Esgar noted that there doesn't seem to be any 'curation on the app either' - essentially allowing users to show whatever they want. Users can report them, or even block, any people that they do not wish to be able to see their videos, and can also hide any or all chats any time by swiping right, scrolling to the bottom of the list of viewers and selecting 'hide chat'. But by then it may already too late. You can't unsee something you have already seen, especially if you are an impressionable child. 'We\u2019ve all heard stories of people sending nude photos to one another either via text or other social media apps,' Mr Esgar explained. 'Now you can easily stream nude videos. Clearly, this opens a lot of potential land mines for parents to now have to try and control.' One user's labeled his Periscope live stream video: 'I'm brabroadcastingom my hotel room in LA. What could be more exciting than that? Stop by and say hello?' Another touted a live video of a 'Crazy party in London'. And then there is the issue of children and teens falling prey to online bullying. Mr Esgar said that he 'witnessed a tireless stream of anonymous people saying things that would be inappropriate for a younger audience. The dangers of online bullying are huge, and Periscope, while a great app when used responsibly, allows bullying to escalate exponentially.' He said the app should alter its features to include stronger privacy options, the ability to block location services, curation of commentary, as well as the addition of parental controls. 'Periscope\u2019s concept is great - live streaming made easy,' he said, before adding: 'But maybe it\u2019s just too easy?'", "answer": "The video app launched last Thursday, but early adapters have already discovered potentially hair-raising issues with the technology .\nApp developer Justin Esgar told Daily Mail Online that Periscope present numerous dangers to children .\nHe warned that parents will have to 'try and control' the various 'land mines' present within the app's system .", "completion": ["Twitter's new live video and audio streaming app, Periscope, has raised concerns due to reports of sexual harassment, online bullying, and potential privacy issues, prompting calls for stronger privacy options, commentary curation, and parental controls."]}

Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' in the first 138 healthy adults who were vaccinated with various doses. The vaccine, developed in Canada, is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the Ebola virus. Scroll down for video . A new Ebola jab is being given to people living in the West African countries most badly hit by the virus. Pictured: a man washes his hands at a checkpoint in Sierra Leone's during the recent country-wide lockdown to combat the virus . When administered, it induces an immune response against the Ebola virus. The researchers, whose findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said one jab protects against a disease which has killed more than more than 10,460 people in a year across six countries including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali. Dr Michael Ramharter, of the Medical Research Unit at Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Lambarene, Gabon, said the Ebola antigen is inserted into the vaccine as a Trojan horse to get the body to develop an immune response against the virus. He said: 'An Ebola glycoprotein from the Ebola strain in Zaire is being inserted into the VSV live vaccine. While VSV only causes mild symptoms in humans, the protein acts as an Ebola antigen and triggers the formation of antibodies against the disease in the immune system.' Dr Ramharter said these antibodies hide, almost like a 'Trojan horse', in the body in order to successfully fight the Ebola virus if the individual becomes infected. Scientists hope that immunisation is possible with just one injection after 'highly promising results' He added: 'Just one vaccine has conferred one hundred per cent protection against Ebola in the initial trials on primates.' Dr Ramharter said the first phase I clinical trial is now complete. He said: 'The vaccine response is very reliable, the vaccine itself is safe and its tolerability is acceptable.' The most significant side effect was found to be temporary joint pain and inflammation reported among a small group of test subjects, particularly in the European centres. In the phase II studies that are now beginning, the vaccine will be used in patients living in the areas currently most badly affected by Ebola, especially Guinea and Sierra Leone, but also in Liberia. The first case of Ebola was reported in West Africa around 15 months ago. According to estimates, around 25,000 people have been infected by the virus - and more than 10,000 of them having died since as a result. The race is on to find ways to prevent and cure the Ebola virus as there are no proven treatments or vaccines to prevent individuals becoming infected. But progress is now being made on an unprecedented scale with trials which would normally take years and decades being fast tracked on a timescale of weeks and months. The aim is to use the lowest dose of vaccine possible that provides protection. Vaccines train the immune systems of healthy people to fight off any future infection.

Norfolk Police continued to look for Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, who has been missing since March 2, and focused on a pond near Carrsville after a new tip. Local resident Steve Hines said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to\u00a013 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time.

A chain of beacons will be lit across the country, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes will take to the skies and a star-studded concert will be held in London from May 8 to 10 as part of commemorations marking the 70th anniversary. The Queen will lead the nation at a religious service . On VE Day - May 8, 1945 - the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, famously joined the jubilant victory celebrations in London and danced the conga through the Ritz Hotel before joining crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Jean Woodroffe, one of the Queen's first ladies in waiting, when interviewed by the BBC to mark the monarch's 80th birthday in 2006 said: 'What was amusing is that we went into the Ritz hotel through one door and out of the other door, the other end, doing the conga.' She added: 'And then we stood outside Buckingham Palace with the crowd and we all shouted 'We want the King' with everybody else until the King and Queen came out onto the balcony.' On the first day of the festivities a national two-minute silence will be held at The Cenotaph at 3pm on Friday, May 8, marking the moment prime minister Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech to formally announce the end of the war. It will be followed by the lighting of more than 100 beacons, stretching from Newcastle to Cornwall. The next day cathedrals across the country will ring bells at 11am in celebration. In 1995, the Queen, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day .

Stars will also perform at a 1940s-themed concert held on Horse Guards Parade in London in the evening, to be shown on the BBC. At the Sunday service the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will be joined by veterans and their families, politicians, members of the Armed Forces and representatives of Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain. A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the Abbey along Whitehall before a reception in St James's Park for 2,000 veterans hosted by the Royal British Legion. The parade will pass the balcony of the Treasury building, where Churchill made his historic speech before vast crowds on VE Day. That afternoon there will be a fly-past of current and historic aircraft from the RAF, including Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster bomber planes from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Vehicles dating from the 1940s will also be on display in St James's Park. People are encouraged to enjoy their own celebrations by holding street parties. Announcing the three-day celebrations last month, William Hague, First Secretary of State, said they would pay 'fitting tribute' to those who did so much to defend the country and ensure victory in Europe.

A Cheer Goes Up For George VI, his wife - later Queen Mother - and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret as they appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 70 years ago on 8 May, 1945 . He said: 'It is right that we take time to reflect on the sacrifices made, not just by those in the Armed Forces, but by civilians such as Land Girls and those in Reserved Occupations and make sure that the whole country has the chance to take part in commemorating this momentous anniversary and remembering those who gave so much for our freedom. 'The celebrations in London will be echoed by other events across the country to mark VE Day 70, with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate. 'They will celebrate with members of their communities who contributed to the war effort throughout the Second World War.' The announcement of the VE Day celebrations came after the Queen attended the traditional Royal Maundy Service in Sheffield yesterday. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty, dressed in a turquoise coat by Stewart Parvin and matching hat,\u00a0was there to present 'alms' to 89 women and 89 men, among them D-Day veteran, Denis Gratton. 'It was just quick. I'm not very good at hearing,' said Mr Gratton, 91, after the ceremony. 'She did say something but I'm not sure what it were.' Handing out alms: The Queen presents a lady with the two Maundy Purses at Sheffield Cathedral . Custom: Monarchs have been presenting Maundy Money since 1210 and King John . The Queen, who had arrived on the Royal Train, was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag-waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers. Met at the church door by\u00a0Peter Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, and the local Bishop, Steven Croft, Her Majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service. After the hour-long service, the Queen posed for pictures with the Yeoman of the Guard, who had lined the cathedral's aisles during the ceremony. The Royal party then left for a reception at Sheffield Town Hall as the recipients emerged into the sunshine, all pleased with their royal acknowledgement. Patricia Durkin, 72, said: 'It was brilliant, absolutely wonderful. When I got here the atmosphere was tremendous.' The Royal Maundy Service is one of the UK's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins. This year, the Red Purse contains a \u00a35 coin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Winston Churchill and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Commemorative: The red and white bags contain commemorative coins, this year featuring Winston Churchill . Tradition: The Queen and Prince Philip were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers . Historically, this sum of \u00a35.50 in the Red Purse is made up of \u00a33 for clothing, \u00a31.50 in lieu of provisions and \u00a31 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money, which, unlike coins in general circulation,   bear the portrait of the Queen produced by Mary Gillick at the start of her reign. Gillick, a sculptor, designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the UK and some Commonwealth countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968. The portrait of the Queen wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years. The Royal Maundy is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment Christ gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before Good Friday. Warm welcome: The Queen is greeted at Sheffield Cathedral ahead of the traditional Royal Maundy Service . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on jolly form as he arrived for the service . In an echo of the Last Supper, mediaeval and Tudor monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service. Unlike the nosegay, which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell, that custom failed to survive the 18th century. The first monarch to take part in a Maundy Thursday service was King John, of Magna Carta and Robin Hood fame, who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in\u00a0Knaresborough in 1210. John was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in Rochester in 1213. John's grandson Edward I, the king known to posterity as 'the Hammer of the Scots', was the first to confine the tradition to Maundy Thursday alone, which, until his reign, could be conducted on any day of the year. Long wait: Many of the well-wishers outside the Cathedral had waited there for hours . Modernising: The 800-year-old tradition used to involve washing beggars' feet - hence the nosegay .

This oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found the hum can drop as low as an E flat, 20 octaves below middle C on the musical scale. In the late 1990s, however, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time. These vibrations aren't powerful enough to be detected by humans, but are strong enough to register on seismometers and similar. Earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that Earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event. This oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found that the hum can drop as low as an E flat, 20 octaves below middle C on the musical scale. In the late 1990s, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time. A team of Japanese and Californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this hum in 2004. Using data from 2008, a French team found that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation. They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds. So the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. As these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance, especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves, and this friction helps create long seismic waves, that oscillate much slower. A team of Japanese and Californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this constant hum in 2004. They proposed that as ocean waves move in opposite directions and collide they create microseismic activity. But Fabrice Ardhuin, a senior research scientist at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France, and his team wanted to put this theory to the test. They began by studying and measuring seismic activity across the globe, including earthquakes, storms and the movement of ocean waves, throughout 2008. During this time, two seismic events with magnitudes of 6.9 and 7.1, took place on 3 March and 20 March. But the largest hum coincided with the strongest seismic waves during the Johanna storm on 10 and 11 March. That storm generated waves with a peak period of 16 seconds that reached heights of up to 42ft (12.8 metres). During this storm, a spectrogram found energy levels reached 10 mHz, and lasted 36 hours. By looking at how much energy was generated by the storm, the researchers were able to conclude that the hum was caused by the storm, and wasn't the remnants of seismic activity from the events. They could then look at the reasons why. 'Ocean waves provide most of the energy that feeds the continuous vertical oscillations of the solid Earth,' said the researchers. During March 2008 two large seismic events took place. But the largest hum  coincided with a Johanna storm (right). The storm generated waves with a peak of 16 seconds and heights of 42ft (12.8 metres) (left). From this, the team could conclude the hum was caused by the storm, and not leftover from the seismic events . Using seismic readings from 2008, a French team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds to complete a single oscillation. They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds . 'The hum contains periods longer than 30 seconds, and the primary and secondary peaks are centered around 15 and five seconds respectively.' Motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on the planet and the team said they can provide information on both the solid Earth structure, the ocean wave climate over the past century, and the properties of short period ocean waves. 'Yet, the use of seismic data is limited because where and how ocean waves rock the Earth is not known, in particular for the hum,' continued the team. 'The hum is the least understood part of Earth's oscillations.' Using the 2008 data, Mr Ardhuin and his team spotted that ocean waves colliding generate seismic activity, but these waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation. The team then studied ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. As these so-called long waves travel over the ocean floor (stock image) and continental shelves they create seismic waves that oscillate much slower. This means that earthquakes, colliding oceans and long waves all combine to create the Earth's hum . They didn't explain why slow seismic waves - which provide the most powerful bell-like ringing - can last for longer than 50 seconds. So the team studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed. These waves are known as long because they travel from the floor to the coast and back again. As these long waves travel over the ocean floor they meet resistance, especially as they pass over the steep continental shelves, and this helps create long seismic waves that oscillate much slower. This means that all three theories - earthquakes, colliding oceans and long waves - combine to create the Earth's hum.\u00a0Although the majority comes from the latter. The findings are published  in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Mr Ardhuin said that by measuring and understanding long, microseismic waves, researchers can learn more about how the Earth is structured. 'Now we know where this ringing comes from and the next question is: what can we do with it,' he told the AGU.", "answer": "It has long been known that Earth is constantly\u00a0oscillating\u00a0and 'humming'\nEarthquakes cause a certain level of hum, but a study claims different sized ocean waves also contribute to Earth's oscillations .\nAs water collides, it creates weak microseismic waves that cause a hum .\nStronger seismic waves then occurs when water travels along the floor .", "completion": ["Researchers have proven that ocean waves contribute to the Earth's constant hum, previously attributed only to earthquakes, with the majority of the hum coming from long waves that meet resistance as they pass over the ocean floor."]}

Supporters compare Stutzman's benefit page to an Indiana pizza shop that raised more than $800,000 after closing when the owner said the shop wouldn't cater a gay wedding. Supporters: An online campaign for Richland, Washington florist Barronelle Stutzman (pictured) has raised over $87,000 after the florist was fined for refusing to provide a gay couple with flowers for their 2013 wedding . Refused service: Couple Robert Ingersoll (left) and Curt Freed (right) were longtime customers at Stutzman's shop, and while she was fine providing them flowers before, she cited her religious beliefs when declining to service their wedding . Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Richland, Washington, received the fine in Benton County Superior Court in March after refusing to serve same-sex couple Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed\u00a0in 2013. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her 'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. After they were refused flowers, Ingersoll and Freed went ahead with a smaller wedding than they had planned. They got married in their home with 11 guests and flowers from another florist. In a February ruling, Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. Along with the fine, the judge's ruling also requires that everything Arlene's Flowers sells to opposite-sex couples has to be available at the same price to same-sex couples. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office requested the fine, said in a statement Friday that the ruling is a reminder of the reach of Washington's anti-discrimination laws. 'My primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,' Ferguson said. 'I'm pleased that today's ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.' Before Ferguson's office filed the consumer-protection lawsuit against Stutzman, it had sent her a letter asking for an agreement to no longer discriminate, which she refused. Ferguson's statement Friday said the office would not have sued if Stutzman had accepted the agreement .

Simon Mitchell, 44, stole the expensive equipment from Donna's Dream House, a charity for terminally ill children based in Blackpool, Lancashire. Following a three year investigation the volunteer worker admitted stealing a laptop and TomTom\u00a0satnav from the charity - despite the fact he was meant to be helping the charity by raising its profile following a devastating arson attack in\u00a02011. Terminally ill fundraiser Simon Mitchell, 44, (pictured left with Richard Hammond and right with Katie Price) stole  from Donna's Dream House, a charity for terminally ill children based in Blackpool, Lancashire . The charity also say Mitchell repeatedly let them down and left\u00a0them\u00a0picking up the pieces when meetings with his supposed star-studded contacts\u00a0failed to materialise. Mitchell had been given the laptop and a phone to use by the Dream House when he volunteered for them but did not return them after he left the charity. He pleaded guilty to two counts of theft at Preston Crown\u00a0Court\u00a0where he was due to stand trial after a three-year criminal investigation. Len Curtis, chairman of the charity which provides holidays for sick and\u00a0needy\u00a0children, said following the hearing: 'He came to us immediately after the\u00a0fire,\u00a0when we were very vulnerable and needed help.

A thug beat up his girlfriend so badly after a cancelled New Year's Eve party that their hotel room resembled a 'bloodbath', a court has heard. Steven Howie, 28, of Dunfermline, left his girlfriend Karen Murray, 31, with 18 separate injuries after assaulting her over  an hour. Howie, a joiner, punched, kicked and kneed her during a prolonged assault, smashed furnishings, and pulled the door of their en-suite bathroom off its hinges. Because the inn was so isolated Miss Murray was unable to get a signal to call police and officers only arrived after guests in another room dialled 999. Stirling Sheriff Court heard that Howie and Miss Murray had been dating for about four months when they checked into the Carronbridge Hotel, in the Campsie Fells. The court heard they then travelled into Stirling for Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle, which were meant to have been headlined by The Waterboys. Lindsey Brooks, prosecuting, said that 'alcohol was consumed' and at one point there was an argument about Howie speaking to another female. Miss Brooks said the argument was quickly resolved, but the Stirling Castle event was cancelled due to bad weather and the pair took a taxi back to the hotel about 10.30pm. When they got back to their room Howie began to shout and swear at Miss Murray calling her a whore and a liar. The depute fiscal said: 'Miss Murray said it came out of the blue. The accused then punched her in the face, causing her nose to bleed, punched her in the stomach, and kneed her in the back numerous times. The couple were staying at the Carronbridge Hotel (pictured) when he beat her in a brutal and sustained attack . 'Miss Murray was unsure how long this went on for, but she was able eventually to get the accused out of the room and lock the door. 'She was unable to call the police because of poor phone reception. 'A couple staying in the room next door heard a disturbance ongoing on and off for about an hour. They heard male voice being abusive, and banging, and a female crying.' The court heard half an hour later the couple heard a male voice saying 'open the door, I'll kill you' and a woman shouting 'go away'. They phoned police who found Howie in the hotel car park, heavily intoxicated, with blood on his t-shirt. Miss Murray was still in the room, which had been wrecked. Mrs Brooks said: 'There was blood on the carpet, on the bedding and in the bathroom. 'The bathroom door had been pulled off its hinges and a shower door had been broken. The bed and bedding were in disarray, and there were smashed lampshades. 'Miss Murray was crying.\u00a0There was also a hole in the bedroom wall.' Howie was arrested and initially gave a false name and date of birth and made no comment to police. Miss Murray was taken to hospital in Larbert, Stirlingshire, where a police surgeon found she had suffered 18 separate injuries. They included a bruising under the eyes and on the nose, damaged lips, scratches, and bruises to her jaw, both arms and both shoulders, her leg and thigh and her abdominal wall. According to the police surgeon, they were the result of 'moderate to severe force'. The pair were due to attend Hogmanay celebrations at Stirling Castle (pictured) on New Year's Eve last year . Howie has now admitted threatening violence, assaulting and injuring Miss Murray, causing damage to the room, and giving a false name to police. His defence agent James Moncrieff said today: 'Since this incident, Mr Howie has not consumed any alcohol. 'He is extremely remorseful and recognises that this is a very serious offence. 'The report makes clear that Mr Howie has had a troubled background.' Mr Moncrieff told the court that Howie and his girlfriend are planning on rekindling their relationship. He added: 'He accepts and she accepts that they are both going to have to address what happened on the night in question.' Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Howie: 'I have taken account of all that has been said on your behalf. 'I am told that your partner who is the complainer, appears to wish to continue a relationship with you, that is a factor that I have taken into account. 'These offences are examples of sustained violence.' Sheriff Robertson said that 'in relation to the circumstances of the offences' and despite the complainers desire to continue the relationship, there is 'no alternative to a custodial sentence.'

I couldn't be a mum or a wife, because I just didn't feel like a woman.' Cheryl suddenly began growing hair on her chest and legs at the age of 12. She had heavy periods from the age of eight. The 32-year-old says her body hair, shown here growing on her arm, has cost her jobs and relationships . Cheryl fought for six years for treatment on the NHS before finally getting approved. She says she had to shave up to three times a day to keep her face, chin and neck stubble-free .

I used to get called Gorilla and Cheesy Cheryl.' She was diagnosed with PCOS and doctors prescribed the contraceptive pill, believing that her problems would improve. Cheryl says: 'The pill didn't help at all. I had periods for 28 days a month and the hair just kept on growing. I had thick hair on my face, breasts, stomach and legs. 'My older brother, John, taught me how to shave my face and I had to shave two or three times a day.' Cheryl was warned she would be unlikely to be able to have a baby, but at 17, she had a one-night stand and gave birth to her daughter Sharon, now 14. Cheryl says: 'He was the first boy to ever show me any attention and I had a one-night stand. But I can't regret it, because my daughter came along.' But with so many personal issues of her own, Sharon struggled with motherhood. She walked out on her daughter, leaving her own mother to care for her. Her doctors believed she had suffered a nervous breakdown. She gradually formed a bond with her daughter - but doctors then found two cancerous tumours on her ovary. They were removed, and she was told she would be unable to conceive again. But in January 2008, she fell pregnant for a second time with her son, Jack, now six. This time, the bond was instant and she adored him. Cheryl says: 'Jack made me see life through his eyes. He would cuddle me and say: \"Mummy, I don't mind your prickles.\" 'His kindness melted my heart.'

But no man likes to see their partner shaving their chest, boobs and chin. It drove us apart.' She has also been targeted by trolls on the internet. Following last year's Eurovision song contest, featuring bearded drag queen act Conchita Wurst, she received Facebook messages saying: 'Did you see yourself on television last night?' and 'Can you see the resemblance?' Cheryl says: 'I had messages pushed through my door and I became too afraid even to go out. I lost my job and my self-esteem was very low. 'But I got lots of support too. People from all over the world apologised for what was said to me. Even Conchita Wurst sent me a message saying \"I really apologise, you shouldn't be penalised.\" 'We are all unique. People should judge a person by who they are, not what they look like.'

Catherine Nevin was allowed out on day release on Wednesday afternoon despite being jailed for life in April 2000 for arranging to having her publican husband Tom shot dead. The 62-year-old was permitted to attend an addiction studies course and was pictured leaving Mountjoy prison and making her way from Dublin's Dochas Centre to the Oblates in the city's Inchicore suburb.

Catherine and Tom Nevin on their wedding day. The 62-year-old was given life in prison for arranging to have her husband shot dead . She walked through the city centre to Dorset Street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course. Ireland's most infamous woman prisoner went largely unnoticed as she took the bus unaccompanied after leaving prison - with an unsuspecting female commuter sitting down next to her - according the\u00a0Daily Mirror. Catherine Nevin leaving the Central Criminal Court in Dublin during her trial in 2000 . Dressed in jeans, a blue fleece top and a pair of black Ugg boots, Nevin took in sights she hasn't seen since being jailed 15 years ago. She laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby Applegreen Garage before her course started. She failed last July to have her conviction overturned, though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent. Her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the Justice Minister. The course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed. Nevin's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the Mounttown Community Facility in Dun Laoghaire last October. While attending that course, run by the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Drugs Task Force, she was always accompanied by prison warders. Completion of the course gives participants a FETAC Level 5 Addiction Studies Certificate. It's believed that as well as attending the course in Inchicore, Nevin has also been using facilities at Maynooth University in Co Kildare and Trinity College over the past few weeks. While in prison Nevin has been keeping herself busy. She has a job in the jail library and likes to do makeovers on other inmates. It was revealed in July 2013 how Scissor Sister Charlotte Mulhall, who is serving life for murder, regarded her as a close friend in jail. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Tom Nevin was shot dead in the couple's pub, Jack White's Inn, in Brittas Bay, Co Wicklow, in March 1996. His wife was also convicted of soliciting three men \u2013 Gerry Heapes, William McClean and John Jones \u2013 to kill him. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of Ireland. The trial and media coverage of the case was dominated by an intense focus on Nevin herself, forcing the judge to order a ban on all reporting of her clothing and appearance. No physical evidence linking her to horrific crime was ever discovered. Her conviction was based largely on the evidence of the three men she is alleged to have solicited. Nevin married Galway-born Tom in 1976. Over the following years they built up a property portfolio, before in 1986 buying the landmark pub where Tom was murdered .

{"input": "Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday. The Southern Poverty Law Center in February filed a lawsuit against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. The lawsuit says prison officials have failed to provide adequate treatment for Diamond's gender dysphoria, a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in the case Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond, who's 36, has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland.

Many children are not ready to sit down and do  reading, writing and maths when they start school at the age of four or five, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). At its annual conference in Harrogate, it will say\u00a0schools should follow the lead of countries like Finland and introduce 45-minute lessons immediately followed by 15-minute play times. Teachers want children to have more play time to encourage greater communication and social skills . They want the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Finland which has 15 minute play time after lessons . It is also likely to say lunch and break times are being used for 'coaching and cramming', depriving youngsters of their 'fundamental human right to play' with their classmates. A resolution due to be put forward at the conference says: 'Primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way.' It goes on to suggest learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that 'over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school'. The motion calls on the NUT to support play in the curriculum at Key Stage 1 (five to seven-year-olds) 'to reflect the needs of the children'. Speaking ahead of the conference, NUT general secretary Christine Blower said many children are not ready for the 'formal sitting down' and 'come on let's do some work stage'' before they are seven. 'There is a question about whether we're expecting children to do things they're not developmentally ready for,' she said. The resolution, set to be heard on Saturday, also says: 'Lunchtime and break times are being used for coaching and cramming sessions, thus depriving primary age children of their fundamental human right to play and have free time to socialise with their peers.' The motion calls on the NUT to support play  for five to seven-year-olds 'to reflect the needs of the children' The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says children have the right to play and rest, it adds. Ms Blower said: 'In Finland, there are 45-minute lessons and then they have a break. Between each teaching session they have a break. One thing about our children is that, relatively speaking, they are rushed from pillar to post. Not so much in primary school, but in secondary school. 'Having a break between lessons gives a bit of space to reflect on the lesson they've just had.' The motion calls on the NUT to campaign in England and Wales for new laws to ensure children have a right to appropriate breaks and lunchtimes.

{"input": "Faris Al-Khori, 62, was found with\u00a0a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats . A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was\u00a0found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were\u00a0responding\u00a0to a 999 call over a fire within\u00a0a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store\u00a0a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that\u00a0much\u00a0of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives.

{"input": "Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Argentina has said it will prosecute oil companies operating off the Falklands coast, as tension rise on the 33rd anniversary of the conflict. Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a 'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. 'The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,' he added. 'The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, 'We should have it'. 'We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest \u00a3180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Yesterday's discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: 'This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.' Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: 'This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.' Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: 'Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically \u2013 look at Alaska, for instance \u2013 but that has never worried the oil industry.' Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was 'an excellent start to the exploration campaign'. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Kirchner\u00a0used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' Documents released by American whistleblower Edward Snowden allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is 'encouraging news', but another well \u2013 called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south \u2013 is the 'most important' in the area. Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in 'ageing infrastructure' and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system.

'When we took him into surgery, we discovered several maggots which were removed. 'We then needed to carry out a full operation to remove the maggots that had managed to go deeper.' But he said the infestation\u00a0had actually saved Mr Lanh's life by eating the infected tissue. He said: 'This sort of fly infestation is extremely rare especially in the skull. 'I found eight references to it in medical literature worldwide and in every case the other patients died. 'In this man's case, however, the maggots had not gone on to eat any of his brain because of the metal plate. 'They actually may have kept him alive by eating the dead tissue that might otherwise have made the infection spread more quickly and killed him.' Lifesavers: Doctors say the maggots (above) ate diseased tissue that could have caused a fatal infection . The use of maggots to cleanse wounds is well known as they can remove necrotic tissue and also disinfect the wound. Mr Lanh suffered his initial head injury while working as a labourer in Malaysia. After surgery to insert a titanium plate, the wound appeared to heal well, although he did suffer headaches occasionally. He said: 'It was mostly OK until a year ago when I noticed it was swollen and sore to touch. 'I didn't want to go to hospital again because I hoped it would heal on its own and even now three years later I'm still paying the bill back for the last operation.

{"input": "Oskar Groening (pictured earlier in the hearing)\u00a0is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted . An Auschwitz survivor who lost 49 family members in the Holocaust says the fact that a 93-year-old former guard at the death camp is on trial is more important than any punishment. Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, who lost her parents and sister, told the Lueneburg state court today that seeing former SS officer Oskar Groening in court is 'a kind of satisfaction.' The 89-year-old says she could never have imagined she would be testifying before a German court and that 'for me it's not about the punishment',\u00a0the DPA news agency reported. Her comments come after another Holocaust survivor\u00a0angered her fellow plaintiffs by forgiving Groening - known as the 'bookkeeper of death' - and said he should not be prosecuted. Eva Mozes Kor, 81, who publicly embraced Groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness, called for the trial to end. By doing so, she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany. Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces a possible three to 15 years if convicted. Prosecutors argue his role sorting prisoners' stolen valuables, to which he admits, helped the death camp function. Mrs Kor made her comments during a television appearance on Sunday discussing the purpose of the trial. She argued that any Nazis still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers in Germany. In response, her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers yesterday saying: 'Our\u00a0clients would not comment here \u2013 who better than a survivor of Auschwitz knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering \u2013 if Mrs Kor did not repeatedly stage her 'forgiveness' publicly. Scroll down for video . Embrace: Seventy years after Auschwitz was liberated, Eva Kor embraced former Nazi guard Oskar Groening . Survivor: Eva Kor spoke of how Josef Mengele stood over her bed and laughed when she was injected with a 'deadly germ' Regret: Groening (pictured) described in chilling detail Wednesday how cattle cars full of Jews were brought to the Auschwitz death camp, the people stripped of their belongings and then  led directly into gas chambers . 'The subject of this criminal procedure is NOT that Mr Groening has done anything personally to Mrs Kor or any of the other co-plaintiffs. 'Whether it is Mrs Kor's place to forgive Mr Groening's participation in the murder of her relatives is up to everyone to decide for themselves. 'But if Mrs Kor says 'these prosecutions must stop' then she should not have become a co-plaintiff.' The statement added: 'We cannot forgive Mr Groening his participation in the murder of our relatives and another 299,000 people \u2013 especially since he feels free from any legal guilt. 'We want justice and we welcome the resolution that this trial brings.' In court in Luneburg last Wednesday Mrs Kor detailed how she and her twin sister Miriam were forced to endure horrifying medical experiments at Auschwitz\u00a0by Josef Mengele, known as the 'Angel of Death'. She told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to Mengele's twisted obsession with twins. He experimented on twins in a sickening attempt to develop genetic techniques for Hitler's dream of creating a 'pure' Aryan race. Mengele used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments, and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived. Despite her ordeal, Mrs Kor found the compassion to forgive her Nazi tormentors - and even unofficially adopted the grandson of SS commander Rudolf Hoess, who oversaw the murder of more than 1 million people at Auschwitz. Liberation: Auschwitz survivors  during the first hours of the concentration camp's liberation in January 1945 . Chilling: A sign over the Auschwitz camp reads 'Arbeit Macht Frei' meaning 'Work makes you free' She spoke after giving evidence against the former Nazi SS guard Groening for his alleged complicity in the murder of 300,000 Hungarian Jewish prisoners at the death camp in the summer of 1944. As a qualified bookkeeper, it was his job to sort and store the Jews' money that the Nazis kept. After giving evidence, she approached and embraced Groening, but added: 'My forgiveness does not absolve the perpetrator from taking responsibility for his actions. Neither does it diminish my need to know what happened there.' She claims Groening was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted. Asked why she had hugged him, she said it had not been planned and added: 'I wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done. 'I was always interested in meeting him face to face because I believe that there is a human interaction that I cannot predict and no one else can predict.' She added: 'I don't forget what they have done to me. But I am not a poor person \u2013 I am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the Nazis.' Mrs Kor later tweeted: 'I met Oskar Groening, introduced myself reached to shake his hand-he grabbed my arm & fainted-I screamed 4 help. It was a strange reaction!!' Both Mrs Kor's parents and two older sisters were killed at the camp.

{"input": "Thousands of children who fail maths and English tests in primary school will be forced by the Tories to re-sit them to ensure they can read, write and add up. David Cameron will today announce that all children who do not pass their tests aged 11 will have to take them again in the first year of secondary school, when they are 12. Around 100,000 pupils a year do not pass the English and maths tests before they leave primary school. The Prime Minister said these children will be given extra help and support to ensure they do not fall behind in secondary school. Thousands of children who fail maths and English tests in primary school will be forced by the Tories to re-sit them to ensure they can read, write and add up (file picture) \u2018The Conservatives are the union for parents,\u2019 he said. \u2018We represent every hardworking mother and father who wants to see their child succeed in a great school. \u2018These past five years have been about getting changes in place which stretch our children \u2013 and the results have been extraordinary. The next five will be about finishing the job. More discipline, more rigour, zero-tolerance of failure and mediocrity. \u2018There\u2019s hardly anything more important to our long-term economic plan for Britain. \u2018There is no job that doesn\u2019t require English and maths and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world.\u2019 From 2016, if the Tories win the election, any pupil who does not achieve a good pass in English and maths tests taken at age 11, will be required to take a resit test in the first year of secondary school. These resit tests will be designed to make sure that pupils who leave primary school without being able to read, write and add up properly have caught up by age 12. Statistics from the Department for Education show that around 100,000 young people - one in five - fail to reach the expected standard in English and Maths at the age of 11. Of these children, only 7 per cent go on to get five good GCSEs including English and maths \u2013 compared to 72 per cent of their classmates who do make the grade. David Cameron will today announce that all children who do not pass their tests aged 11 will have to take them again in the first year of secondary school, when they are 12 . Secondary schools currently receive a \u00a3500 \u2018catch-up premium\u2019 for any child who arrives without having met the expected standard by the time they leave primary school. The Conservatives hope the new resit tests will ensure that secondary schools are using the money effectively and getting young people to where they need to be to succeed throughout rest of their school career. Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, said: \u2018We know that the biggest predictor of success at GCSE is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11. \u2018That means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they\u2019ll struggle for the rest of their time in education. \u2018Under Labour one in three children left primary school unable to read, write and add up properly, thanks to our reforms and teachers\u2019 hard work we\u2019ve seen that fall just to one in five. \u2018But even one child falling behind, or being written off, is a child too many. That\u2019s why the next Conservative Government will require schools to enter any child who doesn\u2019t have the literacy and numeracy skills they need to succeed in secondary school, for new year seven resit tests that will guarantee they\u2019ve caught up. Around 100,000 pupils a year do not pass the English and maths tests before they leave primary school (file picture) The resit tests will be slimmed down literacy and numeracy checks containing content from the assessments taken in the last year of primary school, as well as some content from the curriculum of the first year in secondary school. Schools will be able to enter students twice for the new tests in either spring or summer term of the first secondary school year. The tests will be marked by teachers and publicly reported as part of school performance tables. Last night Tristram Hunt, Labour\u2019s education spokesman, said: \u2018This is desperate attempt by the Tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards. \u2018On their watch, 1.6million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted. And as a result of David Cameron\u2019s unqualified teachers policy, more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers. \u2018Labour has a better plan for education.

A 33-year-old woman who took abortion drugs she bought on the internet to cause a miscarriage and disposed of her fetus in a dumpster has been jailed for 20 years. Purvi Patel, 33, of Granger, Indiana has been jailed after she was convicted on charges of feticide and neglect of a dependent. St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel attended St Joseph's Hospital in Mishawaka, Indiana on July 13, 2013 soon after giving birth. After arriving at the hospital, she denied that she had even been pregnant, even though medical staff found an umbilical cord attached to her. According to court documents: 'Concerned for the child's welfare, doctors continued to question Purvi Patel of the whereabouts of the child. Eventually, she told the medical staff that she had delivered a baby in her home in Granger, Indiana. 'She further told the medical staff that she did not see the child breathing or moving and believed it to be dead. 'Purvi Patel told the medical staff that she put the dead body in a bag and placed it in a dumpster behind the Super Target. She further told medical personnel that she was roughly two months along and had a miscarriage.' The court heard that Dr Kelly McGuire drove to the Super Target store and began searching the dumpsters, having informed St. Joseph County Police. Officers recovered the body in a dumpster behind Moe's Southwest Grill. According to Forensic Pathologist Dr Joseph Prahlow, the body was 12.2 inches long and weighed 1.46 pounds. His report claimed 'the child had been born alive and had taken a breath'. Court records showed that police examined Ms Patel's mobile phone and was able to extract some evidence. According to Detective Galen Pelletier of County Metro Homicide Unit: 'In her text messages, officers found that on June 19, 2013, Purvi Patel admitted to this friend that she was over 60 days pregnant. She also admitted that she had obtained two drugs from Hong Kong, in an attempt to abort the child. 'Purvi Patel told his friend that she began taking the drugs on July 10, 2013.' St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel, pictured, purchased abortion drugs from Hong Kong online . Ms Patel, pictured, told medics that she gave birth to a stillborn and disposed of the body in a dumpster . Ms Patel's lawyer Jeff Sanford said his client was planning to appeal the case within 30 days . Medics claimed the first drug would induce labor while the second was designed to end the life of the fetus, however, only if it was less than nine weeks old. Justice Elizabeth Hurley gave Ms Patel a 30-year jail term for neglect, suspending the final ten. She also handed down a six-year term on the feticide charge which will run concurrently. Handing down the sentence, Judge Hurley said: 'You Ms. Patel, are an educated woman of considerable means. If you wished to terminate your pregnancy safely and legally, you could have done so. You planned a course of action and took matters into your own hands.' According to the South Bend Tribune, prosecutors had urged Judge Hurley to hand down a 40-year jail term. Judge Hurley said she considered Ms Patel's lack of prior criminal history and remorse, but condemned her for treating the baby 'literally as a piece of trash'. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Mark Roule said Ms Patel could have sought help for the infant. 'His only chance at survival was his mother. In this case, the mother did nothing, left him on the floor to die and threw him in the trash.'

The poll also found that 60 per cent of people worry about paved front gardens and flooding. The society is offering tips on how to transform grey areas. Tips include pulling up a paving stone and planting it up, to creating window boxes and planting trees and climbers in front gardens which can cool buildings.

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he\u00a0was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months.

'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat.

Donna Hussey, 32, has also been branded a 'bad mum' by trolls on Facebook over the death of her son Freddie - who was killed when a huge portable cabin came loose from a passing Land Rover. Mrs Hussey, who had just dropped her eight-year-old son Archie to school, was helpless as the runaway trailer mounted the pavement and crushed young Freddie against a wall in Bedminster, Bristol. Donna Hussey, 32 (right), has been targeted on Facebook and branded a 'bad mum' by trolls who blame her for the death of her son Freddie (left) - who was killed when a runaway trailer crushed him against a wall . A passing lorry driver tried to resuscitate Freddie and paramedics arrived within minutes, but he died shortly afterwards at Bristol Children's Hospital. Police investigators found the trailer had not been correctly attached to the Land Rover but driver Tony Davies avoided prison after admitting causing death by careless driving. His sentence infuriated Mrs Hussey and Freddie's father Scott, 37, who blasted his punishment of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service as a 'joke'. Mrs Hussey said her torment has now been worsened further by hateful Facebook trolls who have bombarded her with messages calling her a 'bad mum' since the tragedy in January last year. The insurance worker said: 'Something that has been difficult was the reports that Freddie was behind me (when it happened) and that was not true. 'I've had lots of hurtful comments and people Facebooking me, sending abusive messages that I was a bad mum. 'I see little kids a few steps in front or behind their parents every day. 'I have to live with what happened. 'I loved that little boy and I love Archie so much. Those kids were my world and I just never would have put them in harm's way. 'I just want people, before they start making nasty comments, to really think about how they are with their children and how they feel it is right to judge.

Freddie (left) died after being hit by a trailer which cameoff\u00a0a Land Rover driven by Tony Davies (pictured outside court last week, right). Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving . A trailer used as a workmen's cabin came\u00a0off Davies' Land Rover and crushed Freddie to death against a wall . This is the trailer coupling which failed, allowing the trailer cabin to detach from the Land Rover in Bristol . Bristol Crown Court heard last week how the tow hitch between the Land Rover and the trailer was not secure because the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down. Prosecutor Anna Vigars said Freddie had been walking behind his mother, playing in the puddles and laughing and joking when the accident happened. They had just dropped off his brother at Parson Street Primary School when the portable cabin detached, travelling around 10 or 12 car lengths before mounting the pavement and crushing the toddler against a wall and telegraph pole. The trailer is used on building sites as an area for workers to relax and contained a kitchen area with a table and basic facilities, as well as a toilet. Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving but Freddie's family slammed the 'lenient' sentence and have started a petition to get mandatory safety checks for towing equipment. When Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC handed Davies his sentence, Mr Hussey branded him a 'f****** joke' and called Davies a 'f****** t***'. Mrs Hussey agreed, calling the sentence 'disgusting, no justice at all' before shouting at Davies: 'I hope you rot in hell. You are scum. He was a beautiful little boy.' Mr Hussey revealed how he has suffered panic attacks since the tragedy and lost his HGV driving job because he cannot get behind the wheel. Freddie's parents Scott and Donna Hussey denounced the sentence of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service given to Davies as\u00a0a 'f****** joke'. They have set up a petition calling for tougher rules . Mrs Hussey (pictured left with her husband Scott) said she has received 'lots of hurtful messages' over the death of Freddie (right) who was killed in by the runaway trailer in Bedminster, Bristol in January last year . He said: 'If the law can change then that would be great it is not all for nothing, but we also want to get the sentence changed. 'We feel we have been wronged by the justice system. 'We thought we would get justice but we are back at day one again. It is hard and it feels the past 14 months have been for nothing.' His wife added: 'Since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again, we don't want to get out of bed and carry on. 'We feel like we lost our little boy for nothing. 'He was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came, it all happened so fast. I couldn't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever. 'I saw things no one should ever see. I know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs.' In a moving statement, she earlier described the impact on her family of Freddie's death, and said: 'We have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put Archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother, his best friend and playmate and cannot comprehend how or why this has happened. 'Archie doesn't want to watch cartoons on Saturday morning any more, as this is something he used to do with Freddie.

UKIP MEP Diane James (right) has insisted the party would carry on if Nigel Farage failed to become an MP . But Diane James, an MEP and the party's justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted the show would go on without him and that Ukip was 'not at all' a one-man band.

Miss James who recently stood down as a parliamentary candidate for family reasons, said she had said she 'no aspirations' to lead Ukip, but named three possible successors to Mr Farage \u2013 deputy leader Paul Nuttall, economics spokesman Patrick O'Flynn and deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who are all standing as MPs in May. The poll put the Conservatives on 31 per cent, Ukip on 30 per cent and Labour on 29 per cent in the seat, where Tory MP Laura Sandys \u2013 a moderate, pro-European - is standing down. The Labour vote has shot up in the past month triggering fears in Ukip that Mr Farage could finish in third place. A poll in February, heavily publicised by Ukip, put him on course to win. Ms James named Ukip MEP Patrick O'Flynn, MP Douglas Carswell and deputy chair Suzanne Evans as potential future leaders . Mr Farage said in his recent autobiography: 'The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for me and the party.

At least six Tory MPs will defect to Ukip if David Cameron tries to form another coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage has claimed. The Ukip leader said many Tory backbenchers will rebell if there is another power-sharing deal with Nick Clegg. He told Mr Farage told Sunday Times that he had had conversations with 'more than a handful' of Tories about joining Ukip if the Prime Minister caves into Lib Dem demands on the terms of an EU referendum. Mr Farage said the possible defections were 'potentially very exciting stuff'. He said: 'If Cameron comes back as prime minister in a coalition deal with Clegg and the terms of the referendum are on Clegg lines, not Farage lines, then you may very well see a more serious fracture in the Conservative party than you've seen thus far.

{"input": "Britain's aid budget may have to soar by hundreds of millions of pounds a year because of new EU rules, it has emerged. Despite the fact that the UK has now met the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid, changes to Brussels accounting rules could bump up the bill even more. Official figures released this week reveal that Britain met the target last year, spending \u00a311.7billion on foreign aid projects. The UK is now the second largest aid donor in the world. Spending on foreign aid is set to increase by an extra \u00a31billion over the next two years because of new EU rules . But new EU accounting rules \u2013 to which Britain has signed up \u2013 are being brought in which change the way national income is measured. The new total includes estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running. It means that Gross National Income will rise \u2013 pushing up the amount that will need to be spent on aid to meet the 0.7 per cent target. One aid expert said it could mean an increase of \u00a3500million in the aid budget in 2016 and 2017. The news that Britain\u2019s overseas contributions will swell even further was unpopular with Tory backbenchers, many of whom believe it was wrong to spend so much when the defence budget faces cuts. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: \u2018What is the point of this arbitrary figure of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP? \u2018The idea that if we spend this amount all the world\u2019s problems will end is absurd, or that by providing that magic figure we suddenly become paragons of virtue. \u2018If a change in the formula means the British taxpayer has to contribute yet more in overseas aid ... a lot of people will start questioning the largesse of this country. There are many military figures who just don\u2019t see the logic of putting money into aid instead of defence.\u2019 The new accounting rules are being phased in and the Department for International Development said they would only apply from 2016. Britain met the 0.7 per cent aid target thanks to a frantic effort that meant increasing the budget by 30 per cent in one year. A highly critical Commons report found that ministers had splurged large amounts in the final months \u2013 with few checks \u2013 just so they could say they had met the target. And last November an independent report slammed DfID for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries. Late last year, the change to EU accountancy rules landed Britain with a huge \u00a31.7billion increase in contributions to Brussels. Nigel Farage (left) has called for the foreign aid budget to be cut by up to \u00a310billion . Millions of pounds of British aid money could be sent to war-torn Eritrea \u2013 despite warnings it will be misused by the brutal regime. Diplomatic sources say the European Commission is drawing up plans for a potential \u00a3240million aid package to help stem the tide of asylum seekers heading for the EU. The move would mean a six-fold increase in the level of EU aid to the African state, with Britain\u2019s share amounting to around \u00a331million. Campaigners say Eritrea has one of the worst human rights records in the world, with thousands of political activists locked up and tortured and citizens forced to do military service into their seventies. The move will also raise concerns about the lack of accountability attached to the \u00a31.1billion Britain hands to the EU to disperse each year. More than 20 campaign groups and academics have signed an open letter calling for a halt to the aid package until Eritrea agrees to comply with a UN inquiry.

A church treasurer accused of murdering his wife deliberately veered his 4x4 off the M1 causing it to explode as it hit trees, a court heard today. Leicester Crown Court was told that two dogs and suitcases were also thrown out of the pick-up truck being driven by Ian Walters as it crashed into a line of trees near Markfield, Leicestershire. Yesterday the court was told that his wife,\u00a0Tracy Walters, died after making a flurry of calls to police about sex-obsessed husband in the days leading up to the M1 crash, including one that morning. Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse. Walters, 51, denies the murder of his wife, who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash. A jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that Walters, of  Swindon, was returning home with his wife from a 'make-or-break' week away in North Yorkshire which ended in an argument. Giving evidence to the second day of Walters' trial, several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple, both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4. The first witness, Robin Goss, told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a 'conscious, deliberate' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder. Mr Goss, a 39-year-old training consultant from Buckinghamshire, told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the L200, doing around 70mph in the inside lane. 'Everything was normal,' Mr Goss told the court. 'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left. 'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion. 'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.' Child protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year. He told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . 'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said. Under questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court. Witness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free. Giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust. 'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.' After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told . The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash . Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse . After getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle. 'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.' The court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. He said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.' Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else. 'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.' The trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.

Lisa Williams, 49, hit taxi driver David Coleman three times after finding the\u00a054-year-old brawling with her brother in the street, a court heard. The two families had been 'neighbours at war' since the Colemans moved in next door to the Williams family on St Catherine\u2019s Road, Chingford, in 2007. Lisa Williams (pictured leaving court, left) hit taxi driver David Coleman (right) three times with the hammer during a street fight . On the morning of the attack, the court heard that William's sibling Jonathan\u00a0had smeared mud all over the Coleman's front bay windows. When the victim went to confront him, they got into a fight. James Benson, prosecuting, said: \u2018Mr Coleman is not a small man but fairly well built, Jonathan Williams is bigger built still and is in fact a younger man than Mr Coleman,\u2019 he said. \u2018Between the two of them punches were thrown by both parties, this was before Lisa Williams had anything to do with the incident. \u2018Ultimately the parties say Mr Williams gained the upper hand in the fight as the bigger and younger man, and both me went to the ground.\u2019 At that point the bigger man allegedly straddled Mr Coleman as Williams emerged from their house holding a claw hammer, she then struck him three times to the head. She was only stopped when a third neighbour Bernard Mason, pulled the hammer out of her hands, and his wife Pamela was forced to sit on the her until the police arrived. Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman with a hammer, but claimed she believed he was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic. Warring neighbours: The two families were described as \u2018neighbours at war\u2019 after\u00a0the Colemans (left) moved in next door to the Williams' home (right) Before fetching the hammer she called 999 from  house she shared with her brother and mother, who can be heard screaming \u2018leave him alone, leave him alone\u2019 in the background. Williams was convicted of unlawfully wounding Mr Coleman after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in February. Mr Benson described the two families as \u2018neighbours at war\u2019. The victim told the court that the Williams family had an irrational hatred of him. He claimed they would throw dog faeces over their garden fence and let their pet bark all hours of the day. Mr Coleman also believed they would be deliberately noisy and bang on the walls in the morning so he couldn't sleep after a night shift. However, Recorder Richard Sutton told the family \u2018it takes two to Tango\u2019. In a victim impact statement, Mr Coleman said he still suffers headaches and anxiety as a result of the attack, and often has to take days off work as a result. Isobel McCarroll, for Williams, said: \u2018On the day in questions they were doing home improvements, her brother was out the front and she was doing some gardening, the hammer was in the hallway. \u2018She came across an incident that was in full swing, she was nothing to do with the initial fighting - she came across something that must have been a terrifying scene and she rang 999 first.\u2019 Williams, 49, was jailed for 30 months today at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) after she was found guilty of maliciously wounding Mr Coleman . \u2018She then went and tried to split the parties up, she went back in and she didn\u2019t know if she was going to call 999 again and when she was in she saw the hammer - it might go a considerable way to mitigating the actions that followed. \u2018It was three blows in quick succession and thankfully it was stopped by Mr Mason.\u2019 She said Williams, who has no previous convictions, has been living apart from her family for two years since the incident and the family are now selling their home on St Catherine\u2019s Road. Jailing Williams for two years and six months, the judge said: \u2018You find yourself in a very, very sad situation as you no doubt appreciate, and it has come about because of the situation that has evolved between you and your neighbours. \u2018This in my view was an incident waiting to happen and it was going to be serious and both sides were quite prepared for confrontation as and when it arose. \u2018That\u2019s the problem if it becomes violent, you never quite know where it is going to end - I understand that you thought the only way to respond to what was taking place was to arm yourself and it\u2019s that action that the law finds unallowable and therefore criminal. \u2018I accept that there was a substantial amount of provocation\u2019.

Saeed has been on the run ever since, but returned to his home town in town in north-west Pakistan at the weekend - at which point he is suspected of killing his fiancee's family with the help of accomplices. He is said to have been outraged over her uncle's dithering over the marriage. 'The uncle was being very indecisive about the wedding which infuriated Gul Ahmad,' said police officer Mohammad Jamil. Police were searching for the suspects but they were believed to have fled into the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal area along the Afghan border, where government authorities hold little sway and police are not legally permitted to go. 'We cannot follow anyone there since it is beyond our jurisdiction, and our security would be threatened,' said Jamil. Fled: Saeed, 25, is now said to be in the semi-autonomous Pashtun area, on the border with Afghanistan . The killings took place in a deeply conservative area where women there are often discouraged from going to school and have little choice when it comes to marriage. Pakistani women are often killed by men who feel their honour has been offended in some way.

Valerie Cadman-Khan, 56, from Middlesbrough, appeared on This Morning\u00a0to talk about the incident in which a policeman took her in for questioning amid claims of child neglect. The council worker appeared visibly upset  as she recalled the events of  2008 to presenter Ruth Langsford when her daughter Aimee, now 19, was just 12. Scroll down for video . Valerie Cadman-Khan, from Middlesborough, appeared on This Morning, with her daughter, Aimee, now 19 . The 56-year-old mother was interviewed by Ruth Langsford on This Morning about finally getting justice and winning the lawsuit against the police . Valerie recalled how she was cuffed in front of her scared and crying daughter. But she said the worst part of the arrest was the aftermath in which her abilities as a mother were called into question. She said: \u2018I felt like I had to reaffirm certain things to everybody. I kept saying to people, \"I\u2019m a good mum. I\u2019m a good mum\".\u2019 When questioned on whether she thought justice has been served in court last month, Valerie revisited her feelings towards Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer who arrested her. \u2018I think justice has now been done. When I watched him in the dock and I saw him giving the evidence and lying about me, I felt as though he knew that I knew he was a liar and that gave me relief,' she said. 'I was in a position before where I couldn't do anything and then the tables were turned, because he was in that position and he couldn't get out of the witness box.' Following the incident involving daughter Aimee (pictured right), Valerie's (pictured left) confidence as a mother was called into question . During the interview, Valerie (pictured right) is seen visibly upset when recalling the incident involving daughter Aimee,who was 12 at the time . When asked if she has received an apology yet, Valerie admitted that she had not. \u2018Not yet. They\u2019re waiting for the outcome of the judge's determination and then they will apologise at that point.' Cleveland Police accused Valerie of negligent behaviour, claiming she left the child alone for 45 minutes in the garden. Middlesbrough County Court heard how officer Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer 'lied' to the local authority child abuse investigation to justify arresting the mother of five. On the day in question in November 2008, he had been called to her former partner's home over an unpaid tax bill. Aimee had been left in the man's care and was sitting outside when police arrived. Mrs Cadman Khan was at work. But the police officer began 'banging' on the front door and later claimed the child had turned 'purple' because she was not wearing a coat. Valerie Cadman-Khan has successfully sued Cleveland Police for wrongful arrest after being handcuffed in front of her daughter Aimee when she was 12 . The 56-year-old was led away from her former boyfriend's house in front of her daughter amid false claims Aimee, who has Down's syndrome, had been left alone for 45 minutes in the cold . Upon her arrival at the property Mrs Cadman-Khan, who left work early because she was not feeling well, was arrested and taken away by police. Aimee was forced to watch the incident, all the while screaming: 'I want my mummy,' she claimed. Her mother launched a wrongful arrest suit and has won her case against the force. Her claim for \u00a334,000 in compensation will be assessed at a later date. Speaking of her ordeal the teacher, who works for the council at \u00a0East Coast Training, a pupil referral centre, said: 'It was never about the money - it was about clearing my name after\u00a0the injustice to me and my little girl. Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer was accused of 'freestyle lying' in his version of events . 'This should never have come to\u00a0court, I only wanted an apology. 'All I could\u00a0hear was my little girl shouting \"I want my mummy, I want my mummy\". 'It was horrendous.' After arresting Mrs Cadman-Khan on suspicion of child neglect, Det Sgt Helyer 'lied under oath' to claim Aimee had been mistreated, the court heard. 'He falsely asserted that Aimee had been purple and suggested the client\u00a0had been violent to him,'\u00a0Nick Stanage, barrister for Mrs Cadman-Khan said. 'Sadly this was a witness that even when caught in a lie by the court he\u00a0was unwilling to be honest about it.' 'For a woman of good character from that profession to be arrested and\u00a0accused of allegations of child neglect and cruelty is of the utmost\u00a0seriousness.' He denied maliciously arresting the mother of five, insisting that all of his actions were in Aimee's best interest. 'In the balance of probability it was more likely Sgt Helyer overreacted and was led by his concerns for Aimee,' said Nathan Adams representing Cleveland Police. 'He accepted in evidence he lost his temper and was banging on the door. He was concerned for the mental and physical wellbeing of Aimee.' Judge Gillian Matthews QC however told the court the sergeant had been 'freestyle lying' in his accounts. 'One of your problems is the\u00a0witness has lied. He was prepared to mislead the court in what I call\u00a0freestyle lying,' she said. The force will apologise pending her judgment on suitable reward, Mr Adams added. Mrs Cadman-Khan was left 'humiliated' by the ordeal throughout which Aimee, now 19, could be heard screaming: 'I want my mummy' The mother of five has successfully sued Cleveland Police.

{"input": "On first glance they appear to simply be bland, bleach-white seashells, but when viewed under ultraviolet light they are transformed. Scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old. The technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked. The fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time, like the one labelled A, but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed, labelled B, allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted (C) Instead of being a simple white colour, they were infact covered in streaks of orange, purple, blue and even large pokadots. The scientists now believe the cone snail shells, which come from the northern Dominican Republic, include 13 entirely new species. A deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey, scientists have discovered. The geographic cone snail (Conus geographus) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar, leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety. In this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish. C. geographus is one of the most venomous creatures on Earth, and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters. It hunts in two ways, both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon-like poison-tipped tooth into its prey.No antidote exists for a cone snail sting, which contains a mixture of nerve agents. The new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin. In tests, a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish. Injected into water, it also reduced the movements of fish larvae. There are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails, some of which have attractive and collectible shells. Dr Jonathan Hendricks, a paleontologist at the San Jose State University who led the research, said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify. He said: 'Original coloration patterns \u2014 if not the actual colors themselves \u2014sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light, which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce. 'Once a specimen has been photographed under UV light, it is possible to use photoediting software to reconstruct the original shell coloration pattern. 'This is done by creating a reversed, negative image, which causes bright, fluorescing markings to become darkened, corresponding with regions that were once pigmented.' Dr Hendricks used the ultraviolet technique to examine a range of fossilised shells that were discovered in the Cibao Valley of the northern Dominican Republic. Although it is now a rich and fertile inland valley, millions of years ago during the Neogene it was covered by ocean. All cone snails are venomous and predatory, with many species still around today. They use a harpoon like tooth that injects venom into their prey. In some cases the cone snail toxins are lethal to humans while many have a painful sting. Due to their bright colours and patterns they are often handled by unwary humans, leaving them vulnerable to stings. There are around 700 species of cone snail still living in tropical seas worldwide and around 1,000 species have been found in the fossil record. This image shows three of the fossil shells studied by the scientists as they currently appear without colour . Scientists used UV light to reveal tiny traces of the pigment left in the shell and the patterns they once had . However, identifying these can often be tricky as over time the bright pigments in the shells fade. Exposing them to ultraviolet light causes any remaining organic matter in the shells - like pigment - to fluoresce. It is thought that these compounds in the shells oxidise over time and so light up when UV light is shined on them. Dr Hendricks, whose work is published in the journal Public Library of Science One, compared the cone snail shells he examined with the patterns of those of modern Caribbean cone snails. He found that many of the fossils showed similar patterns, indicating that some modern species belong to lineages that have survived in the Caribbean for millions of years. UV light allowed scientists to peer back millions of years to reconstruct shell patterns and colours as above . Dr Hendricks said: 'This approach \u2014 combined with the exceptional Neogene fossil record of the Dominican Republic, as well as other regional fossil deposits \u2014 has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western Atlantic cone snail fauna. 'Clearly much more work needs to be done to better understand the compounds responsible for shell coloration. 'That said, it seems that oxidation - caused either naturally by exposure of shells to sunlight over prolonged periods of time, or artificially by soaking in bleach for several days - plays a role in causing formerly pigmented regions of fossil shells to fluoresce under UV light, though the reason is not currently understood.' C. geographus (above) is one of 700 existing cone snail species and is one of most venomous living animals .", "answer": "Fossilised cone snail shells found in\u00a0Cibao Valley of Dominican Republic .\nIn visible light they appear to be a plain white colour as the pigments faded .\nUnder ultraviolet light, however, the vivid patterns and colours fluoresce .\nScientists were able to reconstruct how the ancient species once looked .", "completion": ["Scientists have used a new technique to reconstruct the colorful patterns on 28 fossilized cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old, revealing that they were covered in streaks of orange, purple, blue and even large polka dots, and potentially identifying 13 entirely new species."]}

The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .", "answer": "Customers in all areas of the plane will be able to share one selfie shot on Facebook .\nMood lighting introduced throughout plane that is designed to help people with time zone differences .\nFull length bathroom mirror, again in all areas of the plane, can help you keep looking your best .", "completion": ["Virgin Atlantic will allow each passenger one free Facebook login to post updates from 35,000ft, as part of the extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes."]}

Their feud had been reignited a year prior to the anniversary dinner when Montgomery published his memoirs in which he slated Eisenhower's command. But the pair were able to put their grudge on hold for the gathering, which also featured Field Marshal Harold Alexander, who oversaw the Dunkirk evacuation, and Field Marshal Alan Brooke, the most senior military advisor to Churchill during the war. Other esteemed guests included Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, former Chief of Air Staff, 1st Baron Arthur Tedder - Eisenhower's deputy commander for the invasion of Normandy, and Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, former head of Bomber Command.

Mr Dahl's wife, Marguerite Dahl, confirmed on Tuesday that her husband of 40 years died March 23 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His rocks, which formed a brief but remarkably successful craze for several months in 1975, came packed in a cardboard box containing a tongue-in-cheek instruction pamphlet for 'care and feeding' and made him a millionaire. Gary Dahl, the creator of the wildly popular 1970s fad the Pet Rock, has died at age 78 in southern Oregon . Mr Dahl later estimated he had sold 1.5million of them at roughly $4 each by the time the fad fizzled only a few months after it hit the market. In later years, given his success with the Pet Rock, he authored the self help book Advertising for Dummies. Although its popularity was short-lived, the Pet Rock was no more than a standard rock packaged around an amusing marketing strategy. To this day his creation divides opinion among those who look back on it with contempt, and those who admire his ability to sell it. Born December 18, 1936, in Bottineau, North Dakota, Dahl was raised in Spokane, Washington. In 1975, he was a Los Gatos, California, advertising executive when he came up with the Pet Rock idea. The rock - which was simply a common everyday stone - came with a manual which, tongue in cheek, detailed how the owner should take care of it. It also stated how its owners should make it feel comfortable in its new home, how to train it and how it can be used to attack 'adversaries'. The New York Times reported he was later sued by investors after they claimed they received too small a share of the profits and he was forced to pay a six-figure sum. His later inventions included The Original Sand Breeding Kit and Red China Dirt. However, these failed to take off.

In 2000, he was a grand prize winner in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for dreadful prose. His winning entry read: 'The heather-encrusted Headlands, veiled in fog as thick as smoke in a crowded pub, hunched precariously over the moors, their rocky elbows slipping off land's end, their bulbous, craggy noses thrust into the thick foam of the North Sea like bearded old men falling asleep in their pints.' He and his wife retired and moved to Jacksonville in 2006. The Pet Rock craze 'was great fun when it happened,' his wife recalled in a telephone interview. Over time, however, 'people would come to him with weird ideas, expecting him to do for them what he had done for himself. And a lot of times they were really, really stupid ideas.' By 1988, Dahl said he had avoided interviews for years because of what he called 'a bunch of wackos' appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits. Of the little rock that became a household name, he said, 'Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn't have been simpler if I hadn't done it.' Mr Dahl designed and built the Carry Nations Saloon in Los Gatos, his wife said.

A thug who shot a hero policeman in the hand as he was tackled to the ground after threatening to blow another officer's head off has been jailed for 12 years. Michael Olsen, 52, from Dartford, Kent, was challenged by PCs Mark Bird and Robert Wilson after abandoning his car in the middle of the road after ploughing into a traffic island and parked cars. He initially ignored the officers who were pursuing him by car but when they got out he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. When PC Bird lunged at Olsen in a bid to save his colleague he felt a sharp pain through his hand and realised he had been shot. They were able to restrain and arrest him, where they found a bag of bullets in his pocket. The 45-year-old officer, who is now back on duty, and his colleague had been called to a routine traffic accident in Welling on October 3, last year, when the incident unfolded. A Land Rover Freelander had been abandoned in the middle of the road after a crash and a member of the public had called to say the driver had walked off. The police officers went after Olsen in their car and spotted him walking along a nearby residential street where they confronted him. PC Bird, who has been in the force for nearly 23 years, said: 'I challenged him and he ignored us and carried on walking. We stopped the car almost straight away and jumped out. 'As I challenged him again he turned around, pulled out a revolver and pointed it about five or six feet away from Rob's head. He said: \"If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off\".' He added: 'I looked at his eyes, and I thought he means what he says he's going to do, so I went for him with my left arm to try and knock the gun away from him.

Police believe he was on his way to see his ex-girlfriend whom he was banned from seeing under bail conditions. PC Bird added: 'It was literally such a split second thing and we had to try to do something, because we were cornered really, and there was no way we were going to let him go. 'It's only afterwards that you realise the gravity of it. If the bullet had gone through the wrist, it could have gone up the arm and travelled towards the heart. 'Someone was watching over us that night. I'm still here, I'm still a police officer, I'm carrying on.' The officers challenged Olsen but he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. PC Bird stepped in to save him but as he did he was shot in the hand (pictured, his injuries) As Olsen pointed the revolver at the officer's head he threatened: 'If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off'.
